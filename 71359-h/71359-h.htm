</div>
<p class='c010'>It was drawing towards the close of the year
1856 (there may be some among my readers who
can recollect what a dull, foggy, cheerless ending
that year had), when one morning the post to
Marshlands brought with it an Indian letter for
Captain Stondon.</p>

<p class='c011'>The post often brought Indian letters there—long
letters (for though the writer addressed his
epistles to Captain Stondon, he knew they would be
read by Phemie), full of descriptions of the country,
of his occupations, of his prospects, of his hopes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nearly three years had elapsed since Basil’s
departure, but time made no difference in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>regularity of his correspondence. Let him be
busy or the reverse, the young man still found
leisure to despatch his budget of news. Perhaps
he felt that on those letters Phemie lived; that
her existence was only rendered supportable by
the excitement of waiting for his missives, and
hearing them read aloud; that she loved the
sight of his handwriting as she had once loved
the sight of himself; that she counted up the
days as they came and went—counted how long
it was since the arrival of his last letter, how long
it would be before the advent of his next. The
time had passed with her somehow; she was no
longer the girl Phemie; she had changed from the
young wife, from the beautiful gracious hostess,
to a quiet, undemonstrative woman, who tried
with all her heart and all her soul to do her duty.</p>

<p class='c011'>It had come to that—for lack of explanation—even
because of her husband’s excessive tenderness
and consideration, she found she could
only give him duty, never love. Her lover was
gone from her—she had driven him away! Her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>lover, who had not married Miss Derno after
all, who had loved her, her only—Phemie Stondon,
who now sat with her hands folded, and her
untasted breakfast before her, waiting for the
news which Captain Stondon appeared unusually
loth to communicate.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he went away she vowed she would never
ask a question concerning him, and so far she
never had; but now she saw something in her
husband’s face which impelled her to say—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is Basil ill—is there anything the matter?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Captain Stondon looked at his wife as she spoke,
and seeing her pale, anxious countenance—her
eager, earnest expression, turned sick as he answered—“He
is ill; he is coming back to England.
You see what he says.” And he tossed
the letter over to her, and then got up and walked
to the window, and looked out, with such feelings
of bitterness swelling in his heart as were only
imagined by God and himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>He made no man his confidant; but the knowledge
that had come to him among the pines,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>while the autumn wind moaned through the
branches, and went sobbing away into the night,
had whitened his hair, and bowed his head, and
taken the pride and the trust and the happiness
out of his heart. He had his wife safe—as the
world calls safety; there was no speck on her
honour, so far as the world knew. Yet no time
could ever make her seem to him as she had been—the
Phemie he had held to his heart among
the hills. The pure, innocent, guileless Phemie
had gone, and left him in her stead a woman,
whose thoughts morning, noon, and night, were
wandering over the sea; who loved Basil as she
had never loved him; whom he could not accuse
of perfidy, because she had not been false; to
whom he dared not speak of his sorrow, because
he dreaded seeing her face change and change at
finding her secret discovered, her trouble known.</p>

<p class='c011'>And all the time Phemie was wishing that by
any means he and she could come nearer to each
other again—that she could show him more love,
more attention, greater attachment. She was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>very wretched, and she wanted some one to comfort
her; it made her miserable to notice his
whitening hair, his bent head, his feeble steps,
his failing health; she thought of him now with
a tenderness such as she had never felt for him
in the years before any one came between them;
and if she could by any will or act of her own
have kept her thoughts from wandering away to
that man in the far-off land, she would have
done so.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even now she was not glad to hear he was
coming back; she laid down the letter when she
had quite finished it; and her husband, turning
from the window, caught her eyes making a very
long and sorrowful journey into the future. He
knew by that look she was true—knew that the
clear, honest eyes could never have held such a
sad, wistful expression in their blue depths, had
the news not been a trouble to her as well as a
surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was thinking the same thoughts as her
husband at that moment; she was wondering, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>he was wondering, whether Basil were really ill
or whether he was making bad health a pretext
for returning to England; and she was resolving
that if Basil came home unchanged, she
would at all hazards speak to her husband, and let
him comprehend how matters really stood; while
he, on his part, was thinking that, supposing
Basil were playing a false game in any way, he
would either take Phemie abroad, or else—well,
yes—there should be confidence—painful confidence
between them at last.</p>

<p class='c011'>And yet the man’s heart yearned towards
Basil. He had been fond of him as he might
have been of a son; and if he were ill, if he
had overcome his madness, if he could live in
England, and yet not seek to destroy what
measure of peace still existed in Phemie’s heart,
Captain Stondon felt he should be glad to see
the man whose love for his wife had driven
him forth into exile, on British ground again.</p>

<p class='c011'>The mysteries of human nature are inexplicable;
its inconsistencies are never ending. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>any outsider even to attempt to describe all
Captain Stondon had thought and felt about his
wife and Basil—about Basil and his mother—about
himself and Phemie, would be useless. I
can only say that he was sorry and he was glad
at the news contained in Basil’s note. He had
been wretched about the young man; Mrs.
Montague Stondon made his life a weariness
concerning her son. He felt that if Basil died
abroad he should feel as though he had almost
two deaths to answer for. If Basil would only
marry, if Phemie could only forget the love that
had been a curse to her, if he could only see
oftener the look in his wife’s face which had just
comforted him, he believed his declining days
might still be bright with sunshine.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Phemie’s first comment on the letter was
satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course,” she said, “Basil will go to his
mother. He had better not come here. I would
rather he did not learn to look upon Marshlands
as his home again. Do not think me hard,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Henry,” she went on, pleadingly; “I have my
reasons. It was bad for Basil leading the idle
life he did with us, it was indeed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My love, my own darling wife, if you only
tell me what you wish, I will be guided by you.
I think I should have been wise to listen to you
before.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, listen to me now,” she entreated; “if
his health be really bad, give him a handsome
allowance and let him travel. Let him make his
head-quarters with his mother—let him do anything
but come here. You will not give in to him,
Henry?” she went on; “you will be firm; you will
keep our home as it is, without bringing strangers
here again. Will you not?—will you not?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was older then than when this story
opened—older by ten years; but her beauty at
seven-and-twenty was almost as great as it had
been at seventeen; and while she stood there,
pleading against the love of her heart—stood with
flushed cheek and soft, low, tender voice, in the
tones of which there was yet a touch of passionate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>regret, Captain Stondon felt that, though they
had been separated for so long, there would
still be danger for Basil near her; and then he
wished Basil were not returning. He would
have given half Marshlands to have kept him
out of England.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was one thing, however, which induced
Captain Stondon to believe that his relative was
really ill—viz., the fact that he meant to perform
his homeward journey by long sea, to spare
himself the fatigue of the overland route. There
could be no deception about this matter. He
mentioned the name of the vessel in which he
had taken his passage; he stated the period
about which she might be expected to arrive; he
requested Captain Stondon to break the news of
his serious illness to his mother, and ask her
to prepare for his reception.</p>

<p class='c011'>“God knows,” he finished, “whether I shall
ever live to see England again; but if I do, I
should like to stay for a time at Hastings.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Reading his letter over for the first time, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>earnest brevity of his communication failed to
strike Captain Stondon; but the longer he pondered
over Basil’s words, the more satisfied he
felt that he had been stricken down by some
terrible sickness, and that perhaps he was, after
all, only coming home to die.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And if so—better so,” Phemie thought;
“better he should die than that we should have
to live through the past again, with its shame,
and its sorrow.” And then, in the solitude of
her own room, she covered her face with her
hands, and wept aloud.</p>

<p class='c011'>Can the old love ever die? Can we ever bury
that body out of our sight, and heap the mould
upon it, and tramp it into the clay? The men
and the women may change—they may grow old—they
may die—they may pass from the familiar
haunts, and the place which has known them may
know them no more; but still the picture painted
long and long before on the canvas of some human
fancy remains young and fresh and lovely. There
it hangs on the walls of the heart, and not all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>world’s dust—not all the world’s cares—not all
time’s ravages can make those dear features other
than beautiful for ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, well, the dark days were at hand when
Phemie could have nothing but recollection;
when the picture hung in the innermost chamber
would be all she might ever hope to see more;
when the man’s memory would be encircled with
a halo of mystery; when a sad and tender interest
would surround the last hours of Basil
Stondon’s life, giving to his fate that sad and
pathetic interest which was alone needed to
fill Phemie’s cup of love and sorrow full unto
overflowing.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ship sailed, and the ship came, but Basil
Stondon did not arrive with her; neither did the
next Indian mail bring any explanation of his
absence. Captain Stondon wrote to the owners,
who stated, in reply, that they knew a Mr. Stondon
had sailed in the <em>Lahore</em>; but as the vessel
had been laid up for repairs, and the captain and
mates and most of the crew had shipped in a new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>merchantman belonging to the same firm for
China, till the return of the mates or captain
they (Messrs. Hunter, Marks, Son, and Co.)
would be unable to obtain further information.
Meanwhile, they remained Captain Stondon’s
obedient servants.</p>

<p class='c011'>After that there ensued a pause, during which
Captain Stondon wrote to General Hurlford, requesting
tidings of Basil. Before any reply could be
looked for to this communication the news of the
Indian mutiny arrived in England, and throughout
the length and breadth of Great Britain there
arose such a cry of distress and terror as drowned
the sound of any single grief—of any individual’s
solitary sorrow.</p>

<p class='c011'>Straightway down to Marshlands came Mrs.
Montague Stondon—came demanding her son as
though Captain Stondon hid him there in
durance.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You know, now, what has happened to him,”
she said. “He saw what was approaching, and
would not desert his post. You see for yourself.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>And she thrust the “Times” into Captain
Stondon’s face. “General Hurlford is killed;
and Thilling, and Osmonde, and hundreds of
others whose names are not mentioned; and
my boy is dead too—murdered—butchered, and
by you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Marshlands never witnessed such scenes previously
as were enacted within its walls for a
fortnight after that. Mrs. Montague would not
stay in the house of her “son’s murderer,” but
remained at Disley, where she made descents on
Captain Stondon, whose life she almost harassed
out of him by entreating that he would obtain
accurate information for her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I could but know where he was buried, it
would comfort me,” she said. And then she relapsed
into violent hysterics at the idea that perhaps
he was not buried at all. “First my
husband—now my son. And it was your
doing, his going out there,” she would remark
to Captain Stondon, Phemie, and Miss Derno.
“You were all against him—all. Because he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>was next heir you hated him. You sold him
into captivity as Joseph’s brethren sold him;
and now he is dead, and I shall see his face no
more.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“One ought not to speak ill of the dead,” remarked
Miss Derno. “But sure am I that
whatever has happened to Basil, he never of his
own free will, got into the middle of that mutiny;
and it is perfectly unreasonable for you to insist
on anything of the kind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is he, then?” demanded Mrs. Montague.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That I am quite unable to tell you,” answered
Miss Derno. “If only for Captain Stondon’s
satisfaction, I wish I knew. But my belief
is that Basil is not dead at all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish I could believe that, Miss Derno.
Oh! I wish I could,” said Captain Stondon.
And the poor old man, utterly broken down by
the absence of the son and the reproaches of the
mother, burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>At this period Phemie took the most decided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>step of her married life. She forbade Mrs.
Montague Stondon the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You shall not come here,” she said, “and
speak to my husband as you do. We are as sorry
about Basil as even you can be.” For a moment
she faltered. “We did all we could for him while
he was in England; and if anything has happened
to him, Captain Stondon is not the one to
blame for it. He cannot bear these reproaches.
He is not able to leave his room to-day; and the
doctor says he must be kept perfectly quiet, and
free from excitement.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Mrs. Montague Stondon broke out. She
denounced Phemie as a scheming adventuress;
she spoke of Captain Stondon as a cold-blooded
murderer. She declared Miss Derno was a
disappointed woman, and that Phemie had
wanted to catch Basil for her cousin Helen;
failing in which object, and angry at having no
children to succeed to the estate, she sent him
abroad to die.</p>

<p class='c011'>She showed how grievously the idea of losing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Marshlands had affected her. She declared the
only reason Phemie wished to prolong Captain
Stondon’s life was because at his death she would
cease to be a person of consequence.</p>

<p class='c011'>To all of which Mrs. Stondon listened quietly,
till the speaker was quite exhausted, when she
took her by the hand and led her towards the
door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am not going to put any indignity on
Basil’s mother,” she said; “but as no person
shall have a chance of uttering such words before
me twice, I mean to see you to your carriage
myself, and must beg you never to enter the
gates of Marshlands again so long as I am
mistress here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A servant was standing in the hall as the pair
passed out together—and so Mrs. Montague had
to content herself with hissing in Phemie’s ear—“I
hope I shall live to see you a beggar,
to see you back in the mud he picked you
out of.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are very kind,” Phemie answered, aloud,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>and she remained at the hall door watching the
carriage till it disappeared from sight. Then she
turned away and walked slowly up the stairs, and
along the wide passages, and entered the room
where her husband was lying in bed, with the
doctor seated beside him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That letter, dear,” he murmured; “that
letter we had this morning. I am afraid I shall
not be able to make the inquiries for some time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you are better to-morrow, shall I go to
town and see Mr. Hunter?” she asked, “or
should you like me to send for my uncle?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should like you to do both,” he answered;
and accordingly the next day Phemie started for
London, and proceeded from the Eastern Counties
Railway Station, where Duncan met her, to
the offices of Messrs. Hunter, Marks, Son, and
Co., Leadenhall Street.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will come and stay with us?” Duncan
said. The “us” referring to himself and his
sister Helen, who was his housekeeper; but
Phemie refused.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>“I must return to Marshlands as soon as possible,”
she said. “I feel wretched about being
away at all, only it was a comfort to Captain
Stondon for me to come up and learn what Mr.
Hunter had to tell us. They have got his boxes,
Duncan.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then he did sail?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am going to hear all about it—all they can
tell me.” And she looked out at the block there
always is at the point where Cornhill and Gracechurch
and Leadenhall Streets join, in order to
hide her face from Duncan.</p>

<p class='c011'>The punishment was not over; it was now but
the beginning of the end.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Hunter received her in a large office on
the first floor, which was well, not to say luxuriously,
furnished. There were comfortable
chairs, there was a library-table in the centre of
the room, the floor was covered with a turkey
carpet, the blinds were drawn down over plate-glass
windows. The only articles out of keeping
with the generally stylish appearance of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>apartment were three large boxes, one of which
had been opened, and to which Mr. Hunter
directed Mrs. Stondon’s attention.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We advertised those boxes for months, and
at last opened one of them. It is so unusual a
thing for passengers’ luggage not to be labelled,
that when Captain Stondon applied to us for information
we never thought of associating that
luggage with his missing relative. But the papers
we have discovered leave no doubt as to the
gentleman’s identity; and one of the sailors, who
was laid up from the effects of an accident when
the <em>Singapore</em> was ready for starting, has since
called here and given us full particulars on the
subject of his fate. He says he remembers a
gentleman being carried down to the <em>Lahore</em> the
very morning she sailed. He looked in a dying
state when brought on board, and before a week
had passed all was over. He was buried the next
day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where?” Phemie interrupted—then—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, my God!” It was all the moan she ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>made, but she reeled as she uttered it—reeled
and would have fallen but that Duncan caught
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is but one burial-place for those who
die at sea,” was the reply, spoken gently and
hesitatingly. “Far from land, it is impossible to
do anything with the body except——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did not know that this lady was so near a
relative,” began Mr. Hunter, apologetically; but
Phemie broke across his sentence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What more? He was buried, you say?
Had he no one with him—no servant—no
friend?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He had his servant, the man tells me, who
took the bulk of his luggage away with him
directly the <em>Lahore</em> came into the docks. He
must have satisfied the captain on the matter by
some plausible tale, or else he would not have
been permitted to do so. How he chanced to
leave those boxes I am at a loss to imagine, for
I conclude his object was to appropriate the property.
We can hear nothing further, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>till the return of the <em>Singapore</em>, for the surgeon
who was on board the <em>Lahore</em> has gone on even a
longer voyage, and will be away for three years.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The passengers?” suggested Duncan.</p>

<p class='c011'>“True,” answered Mr. Hunter, “you might
learn something from them. About these boxes?
You would wish them sent on to Marshlands, I
presume?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” said Phemie; “his mother ought to
have everything belonging to him. I will write
to her, and then she will say where she should
like them forwarded.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She asked no more questions, she made no
further remark; there were no confidences exchanged
between her and Duncan on their way
back to the station, only as he stood by the carriage
window waiting till the train should move
off, her cousin said, a little bitterly—</p>

<p class='c011'>“How fond you were of that man, Phemie.”
And she replied—</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you had died far from home and friends as
he did, should I not be sorry for you too?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>She put up her face and kissed him as she
spoke these words. The Phemie of old was
dead—the vain, fanciful, exacting Phemie; but
for my part, I love better the Phemie who sat
back in the carriage all the way down to Disley
than the Phemie who had looked out over the
flat Cambridgeshire fields five years before.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was over—with her as with him; she had
earned her wages, and they were being paid to
her as the months rolled by. Death—he was
dead! What had life to offer her in the future?
what could the years bring to her worse than
this?</p>

<p class='c011'>At Disley, the carriage was waiting for her, and
something in the footman’s face as he stood aside
while she entered it, made her pause and
ask—</p>

<p class='c011'>“How is your master?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He has been worse since morning, ma’am;
the doctor was with him when we left Marshlands.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drive fast, Sewel,” she said to the coachman;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“do not spare your horses.” And accordingly
Sewel took his favourite pair of bays back
to Marshlands (to the intense astonishment of
society) at a gallop.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II.<br> <span class='c009'>WIDOWED.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Phemie was not in the house two minutes
before she knew her husband had had a paralytic
stroke. The doctor was still with him; but in
such a case, what can a doctor do? When the
Almighty strikes—when the blow falls, which no
skill is able to avert—of what use are God’s
instruments?</p>

<p class='c011'>From that day Phemie’s work was laid out for
her. To nurse him, to tend him, to take the
man who had raised her from poverty to wealth,
hither and thither as the medical men advised,
or as his own fancy dictated; that was the
employment of Mrs. Stondon’s life.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Aggland, now a widower, came and stayed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>at Marshlands; he it was who propped the sick
man up in bed—who read to him—who amused
him—who accompanied them from place to place—who
thought that never a husband had found so
devoted a wife as Phemie—who made his head-quarters
in London, that he might be near his
niece, and who, after Mr. Keller’s death, made
his head-quarters at Roundwood, Mrs. Keller
not desiring to continue her residence there.</p>

<p class='c011'>Phemie was a great woman at last. An heiress
in her own right—a person who, without any
Marshlands at all, could have taken a high place
in society; and yet the Phemie of those days
was humbler, sweeter than the Phemie who had
dreamed dreams in the valley of Tordale—who
had lingered beside the waterfall, and sat beside
Strammer Tarn.</p>

<p class='c011'>How did her new dignity of heiress become
her? many a reader may want to know; and
yet I think the reader who asks that can have
read the life-story of Phemie Keller to little
purpose.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>How does wealth affect those who have discovered
the powerlessness of wealth to confer
happiness? How did wealth affect this woman
who had not found wealth do much for her?</p>

<p class='c011'>It simply suggested to her one idea—that
money had come too late; that her life had been
throughout one great mistake; that, as a rule,
lives were great mistakes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The burden of the song was sorrow—the
refrain of the song was work. And her work,
as I have said before, was laid out for her: she
had from the day she returned from London to
attend to her husband, ceaselessly.</p>

<p class='c011'>They went for the winter to Hastings. The
doctor recommended it, and Phemie went
wherever the medical men desired.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now the sea talked to her differently: all
through those long, dreary, interminable months
she listened to the winds and the waves while
they mourned to her of Basil’s last resting-place—of
the restless ocean, in the midst of which he
had lain him down to sleep.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>In those days there was no one to come
between her and her husband—no one; friend—nor
lover—nor relation—and accordingly Phemie
was able to devote herself to him heart and soul.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a time he seemed to rally, but the constitution
was too enfeebled—the shock had been
too severe. While they were at Hastings, Captain
Stondon had a second stroke; and though
his doctor pooh-poohed the calamity to Phemie,
still she felt unsatisfied, and paid a visit to a
London physician on her own account.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If a person have a second paralytic stroke,”
she said—“remember I want the simple truth—what
is the usual consequence? Can the patient
recover?”</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment, the man of large experience
hesitated, then he said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“After a second stroke, as a rule, there can be
but one thing more—a third——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Which is——” Phemie suggested.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Death.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She turned away—she felt suffocating. Death!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>He had been her best friend through the most
trying period of her life; and she had loved—oh,
heavens! in spite of all faults and shortcomings,
she <em>had</em> loved him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should like you to see my husband,” she
faltered out. And then the doctor was very
sorry for his words; but he went down to Hastings
to see Captain Stondon notwithstanding.</p>

<p class='c011'>She wanted to get him back to Marshlands;
but the medical attendants shook their heads.
She would have given anything to be able to
move him to his own home; but the physicians
said that unless a decided change for the better
occurred such a journey was not to be thought of.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You would like to get back, dear,” she said
to him, when the spring buds were jutting out—when
the primroses were springing in the hedges—when
the hyacinths in Fairlight Glen were
showing for flower; and the poor lips that could
now answer in nothing save monosyllables, framed
the one word—“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shall I try to move you there, darling?” she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>asked; and the dim eyes lighted up with pleasure,
and the wan fingers clasped hers tighter,
and over the white lips passed the monosyllable
“Yes!” once more.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You do not like this place,” she went on,
fearful that her own detestation of the sea—the
cruel sea, might be leading her astray with
regard to his wishes; and he answered, “No!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then she resolved to move him. And she
did it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before a fortnight was over he was lying in his
own room at Marshlands, listening to the song of
the birds—to the cawing of the rooks—to the
sweet spring sounds—that never seem quite
the same when heard away from home.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the years gone by he had wished a wish—he
had prayed a prayer; and now, when the dark
days were come upon him—when his strength
was turned into weakness—his noon changed to
night—when he lay unable to speak—unable to
move—the memory of that prayer came back to
him.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>“O God!” he said, when he stooped over the
pool, and drank of the waters, “when Thy good
time comes, leave me not to die alone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Through the days that had passed since then,
his soul went back. Tordale was with him in
the time of which I am now writing, as the days
of his boyhood were with him when he lay
bruised and maimed at the foot of Helbeck.</p>

<p class='c011'>For ever he was turning round that rock which
brought him within view of the valley and the
waterfall and the everlasting hills. Eternally
the dull plash of the stream as it fell over the
rocks—the faint rustling of the leaves—the
mourning farewell of the rivulet—the trickling of
the water among the stones—sounded in his ear.
Dead as he was to the scenes of this beautiful
world—powerless though he was to lift himself
up and look forth on God’s earth, which he had
loved so dearly, still he could remember many
things, and amongst them Tordale, which he had
once said lightly he should never forget.</p>

<p class='c011'>Never! for ever! There he had been happy—there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>he had met Phemie—there he had heard
that sweet girlish voice singing the old Covenanting
Hymn—there he had wooed and won her,
and now the tale was told—the sands were running
out—the sun was near its setting—the end
which comes sooner or later to all human hopes
and fears, troubles and pleasures, was drawing
nigh unto him; the wife who had never loved
him as much as he had loved her, still hung over
his sick-bed, and anticipated his lightest want.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If she could but know.” And in those hours,
had speech been vouchsafed to him, he could
have talked to her about their common trouble.
“If God would but give me power to talk once
more, I would not remain silent as I have done.”
And with light from eternity streaming in upon
the pages of the past, he saw that his silence had
been wrong, his forbearance useless; he vaguely
comprehended that if he had opened his heart to
Phemie in the days gone by, Basil need not have
left for India, while perfect confidence would have
reigned between him and her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“But she will understand it when I am gone,”
he thought; “she will know then how I loved her
through all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>That was the story the weary eyes tried to tell
Phemie as they followed her about the room;
that was the assurance he tried to convey when
he clasped her soft hand—when by sign and
gesture he kept the dear, pale, changed face near
to his own; when he looked at the white cheek,
white and worn; when he strove to return the
remorseful kisses she laid upon his lips.</p>

<p class='c011'>Summer came—summer with its sunshine,
its roses, its mirthful gladness, its wealth of
beauty and of perfume—summer came and
shone down on the sweet valley of Tordale once
again.</p>

<p class='c011'>Twelve years previously, Captain Stondon,
seated in the church porch, shaded from the
mid-day sun, wearied with his walk from Grassenfel,
had speculated vaguely upon death; and
now, lying in his bed at Marshlands, with the
windows flung wide to admit both air and sunshine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>tired with his long walk through life, he
thought about death once more.</p>

<p class='c011'>After all, when it comes to this with any person,
no existence seems to have lasted for years,
and years, and years. There has been a sunrise
and a noontide and a sunset; the day is done,
the night draws on, the task is finished, the
labourer hies him homeward from the last hour’s
work he shall ever be called upon to perform.</p>

<p class='c011'>What more—what more! Oh, friends, the
longest life ends with some work, to our thinking,
left unfinished—some seventh unresolved—some
lesson unlearnt; but who amongst us can
tell the why and the wherefore of this mystery?
Who can explain the meaning of this universal
law? We can write the story up to a certain
point, but there our knowledge ceases.</p>

<p class='c011'>When mortal sickness comes to put a finish to
the life-history, what can any one say further?
The man has lived, the man has died, the day is
ended, the night has closed in. Draw we the
curtains, and leave the room—there is nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>further to be written; sleep has come to the
tired eyelids—ease to the worn-out frame; there
is great peace where there was much suffering.
The heat has been borne, the burden is laid
aside; the wayfarer has reached his long home;
the unquiet heart is still; in the shadows of
evening man ceases from his work and from his
labour, and sinks to his long rest.</p>

<p class='c011'>What more? Nothing, my readers; that is,
nothing of the stranger whom we met so long
ago gazing in the summer sunshine upon Tordale.
Captain Stondon was dead, and Phemie—a
widow! and there was no direct heir to Marshlands.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.<br> <span class='c009'>THE LETTER.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>When trouble came upon her, Phemie was not
left alone to bear it. Kind hearts and loving
sympathised with her—friendly hands clasped
hers—true men and women were near to give
what comfort they could, or, at all events, to
share in her distress.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Aggland and Duncan, and Helen and Miss
Derno, were all with Phemie when the end
came. Norfolk was importunate in its inquiries—Norfolk,
professing to feel very sorry about
Captain Stondon’s death, wondered who would
succeed to the property, and whom Phemie would
marry.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Ralph Chichelee had hopes—intentions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>rather, would perhaps be a better word; but
then other people had intentions also, so perhaps
it is scarcely fair to mention his in particular.</p>

<p class='c011'>Phemie was still beautiful enough to attract
admiration—still young enough to love and
be loved—still fascinating enough to choose a
second husband and rule over a new home. The
prospect opened out before Phemie by Captain
Stondon’s death seemed to society like a vision
of fairyland. She might marry an earl. The
Duke of Seelands had inquired particularly who
she was one day when he beheld her driving
from the Disley Station. How would Phemie
like the strawberry leaves? Norfolk began
forthwith to wonder, while the man who had loved
her so well was lying dead in one of the pleasant
rooms at Marshlands. Concerning “that young
man Aggland” the gossips had also something
to say; they marvelled if, instead of marrying
for rank, Phemie’s uncle would trap her into
wedding her cousin. Where would she live?
What would she do? She possessed a fine property
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>of her own, and doubtless Captain Stondon
had done well pecuniarily by his wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>Was not this a dainty dish for a county to
feast on and speculate over? while the flavouring
was supplied by an all-devouring curiosity to
know who was the next heir male. Remote
relations, unheard of before, came from the uttermost
parts of the earth to claim the property.
Stondons who had gone down in the world—Stondons
who had gone up in the social scale—arrived
at Disley when the news of Captain
Stondon’s death was noised abroad. There was
no near heir, and every man of the connection
consequently claimed to be next-of-kin. Who
would be master? What would Phemie do?
Whom would Phemie marry? What a pity she
had no children—what a sad thing it was Mr.
Basil Stondon had gone abroad! These were
the questions and remarks everybody made and
everybody asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>As for Phemie, she grieved for her dead husband
with a sorrow which was neither conventional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>nor circumscribed. The best friend
woman ever possessed he had been to her
through all the years of her married life.</p>

<p class='c011'>Through that part of her existence when she
may be said to have lived he had stood beside her.</p>

<p class='c011'>In sickness, in sorrow, in prosperity, he had
thought of her, and of her only. No one in the
after time could ever be so fond or proud of her
as he had been; no one could ever step in and
fill his place. She had never had to think for
herself—to take any trouble which his love could
keep from her; he had been true and faithful
and tender, and the return she had made would
have broken the heart of the man who now lay
so still and stiff, could he have known it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Better so,” she thought, “better so. I
would rather see him thus”—and she kissed the
cold brow and lips—“than imagine his grief,
could he have guessed what I was—I whom he
trusted—too well, too well!” And she wept
through the hours beside his coffin till her
friends forcibly removed her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>“I never loved him enough—I never knew till
now how much I loved him,” were the contradictory
sentences she kept constantly repeating;
and then Miss Derno, who could guess so well
wherein the worst sting of this death lay, drew
the poor weary head on to her breast and rested
it there.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I was once very unjust to you,” Phemie
went on, sobbing out her confession. “There
was a time when I thought I did not like you,
and it was wicked of me to misjudge you as I
did. You forgive me, dear, don’t you? and you
will not ask me why I misjudged you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I forgive and I will not ask. Shall we be
friends now—true friends for evermore?” And
she bent down till her curls swept Phemie’s face,
and then the poor trembling lips touched hers,
and the widow broke out sobbing more passionately
than ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>So the days wore on—the weary days with
death in the house—till at last the morning
came when all that was mortal of Captain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Stondon passed out of the gates of Marshlands
and on to the churchyard at the other end of the
hamlet. He had gone for ever. Phemie realised
that fact when she stole to the room where he
had lain—when she understood that she had
looked on his face for the last time in this world—when
she turned desperately towards the
future, and confronted it without his help—without
his supporting hand—without his encouraging
voice—alone—wholly and entirely, so far
as the close companionship, as the watchful
care given to her by Captain Stondon was concerned.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had not valued him living, and now he
was dead.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had sorrowed for that man lying under
the sea, and there was treason in her sorrow
towards the husband just taken from her. Even
indeed in that bitter hour she could not put the
memory of Basil aside—could not help thinking
how hard it was he had been taken in his youth
and hope away from earth, away from Marshlands!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>She thought this, and then, with a despairing
moan, knelt down in the room where she should
never more see her husband, and cried till the
fountain of her tears seemed exhausted, till, for
very faintness and weariness, she could cry no
more.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Captain Stondon’s will came to be read,
it was found that he had indeed remembered his
wife with the most generous and ungrudging
trustfulness.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had saved and purchased—purchased this
little estate and that small farm; invested in
some paying companies, and accumulated money
for her benefit. With the exception of an annuity
to Mrs. Montague Stondon, and some few legacies,
he left Phemie the entire of his personal
property, all he had been able to put by during
the years since he came into possession of
Marshlands. There was no condition attached;
he said nothing about a second marriage, he
made no proviso, he attached no restrictions, he
left almost everything he owned in the world, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Phemie absolutely after his death, just as in life
he had given her his heart and his substance,
wholly and unconditionally.</p>

<p class='c011'>As for Marshlands, of course it had to go to
the next heir—but who was the next heir?</p>

<p class='c011'>There were not wanting claimants in abundance.
Stondons from Devonshire, Stondons
from Perth, Stondons from Ireland, Stondons
from abroad, were eager in pressing their separate
claims. Old men and young, men who
looked as though they had been buried for a
hundred years and then dug up again, and let
out for a day to state where they were born, and
who had been their father—men again who were
worn and haggard, to whom even a few acres of
the great estate would have been ease and competence—men
who had all their lives long been
fighting the battle of poverty, and probably
pawned some of their goods to defray the
expenses of the journey—men fresh from their
oxen and their ploughshares, who had come
“parly,” with a sharp country practitioner: all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>these laid siege to Marshlands, and strove to
make their title appear good; and whilst they
were wrangling and disputing over the matter,
Phemie still clung to the old walls like a cat,
reluctant to quit the place where fires had once
blazed cheerfully for her.</p>

<p class='c011'>She wrote to her late husband’s lawyers,
begging them to give her timely notice when the
new owner might be expected, and the answer
which came back sounded to her like the voices
of the dead.</p>

<p class='c011'>They enclosed a letter which, “as she would
perceive,” Captain Stondon had instructed them
to forward to her a month after his decease,
whenever that might occur, and they begged to
assure her she should have full information
whenever anything definitive was settled. They
(Messrs. Gardner, Snelling, and Co.) thought it
was useless considering the claims of any other
person until the fact of Mr. Basil Stondon’s
death was proved past doubt.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Proved past doubt.” Oh, heavens! is it not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>hard to think that what is evidence sufficient for
love is not evidence sufficient for law? Till that
instant Phemie had never for a moment doubted
the accuracy of the tidings which had reached
England, but now, with a bound, hope sprung to
life again.</p>

<p class='c011'>It had been so easy to remain true to her
husband with Basil dead; but Basil living!
Over and over and over she conned the lines
suggesting this probability, while the other letter—the
enclosure, the message from the newly-made
grave—lay unheeded beside her.</p>

<p class='c011'>To do Phemie justice, she did not couple
together the sentences—Basil is living, and I am
free. She had never thought of marrying him,
and she did not now; but she had loved him,
and, as I have said, the old love never dies; it
is the one thing in this mutable world which is
immutable; it is the one temporal possession
of our mortality which is immortal. She could
not kill it, she could not bury it; the winter’s
frosts and the winter’s snows had lain upon it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>yet here it was, springing up fresh and green
and fair and beautiful as ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>If he were but alive! and then all at once her
eyes fell on her black dress, and she remembered
with a shock the man who was but too surely
dead. There lay his letter, with this written on
the outside—“To be given to my wife one month
after my death in case she survives me; to be
burnt in the event of her dying before me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It always seems a solemn and a strange thing
when the idea of his or her own death is presented
as a precautionary possibility to the mind
of a person in health.</p>

<p class='c011'>Insurance forms, for instance, appear to put a
matter about which most people, I suppose, think
sometimes after a fashion, in a new light before
the senses of an intending insurer.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a regular debit and credit statement.
You may die—you may not die; you are such an
age, and inasmuch as you are such an age, the
chances are against the length of the years to
come; on the other hand, you are healthy, active,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>temperate. It is not a sermon, it is not a warning,
it is not a mere possibility; it is a rule-of-three
sum worked out, not very accurately it may
be, but still calmly and dispassionately. You
may die, you may not die, and you are rated
accordingly; you may live, you may not live,
and the law and common sense take precautions
in consequence.</p>

<p class='c011'>When that letter was written the future lay
shrouded from view, that future was the present
now, and he had died; but she might as well
have died, and then—why that letter would have
been burnt, and she never a bit the wiser.</p>

<p class='c011'>Life’s firmest ground is insecure, its strongest
fortresses powerless against the touch of the
great destroyer. Vaguely this idea took root in
Phemie’s mind as she read the lines I have
copied, ere breaking the outer seals and taking
out the letter folded inside.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mrs. Stondon” was the direction on the
cover, but on the actual envelope were traced
the words—“To my dear wife,” and the paper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>that envelope contained began—“My dearest
Phemie.” His! The hand that penned the
sentence, that had been warm when the letter
was folded, sealed, and directed, was cold enough
now.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well-a-day!—ah, well-a-day!—there are many
bitter hours in life, and one of those hours was
striking for Phemie then. In the twilight she
sat reading, while her tears fell fast and hot on
the paper; in the twilight she understood at last
the nature of the man she had loved so lightly—the
man who, in the time of his fiercest trial,
wrote thus to the wife whose heart he found had
never throbbed with love for him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>My dearest Phemie</span>,—When you receive
this I shall be lying in my quiet grave, and you
will be my widow. To you, my widow, I write
that which I could never have said to my wife.
It seems to me at this moment that I am almost
writing these words from another world, for the
old things bear new forms, and life itself is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>changed to me within the last few hours. My
love, my wife, my child, I know all now—your
strength, your weakness, your secret; and if I
could give you happiness at this moment by any
personal sacrifice, God is my witness—God in
whose presence I shall stand when you read this—that
I would try to do so; but, my darling, it
is impossible. I cannot undo the past: let me
try to make amends in the future.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did wrong, Phemie—I did wrong; but it is
only within the last twenty-four hours that I see
this. I was old, and you were young; I was rich
in money and love, and you in youth, beauty,
virtue, the power of winning affection. In your
inexperience, my darling, I took you unto myself,
away from all chance of happy love—away to the
temptation to which I have exposed you. Blind!
blind! blind! I thought I could have made you
so happy, Phemie, and I have learned that it was
not in my power to do so. Forgive me, dear—forgive,—for
I am very penitent, and very miserable!</p>

<p class='c011'>“What I want to say to you, my darling, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>this. If, when you read these lines, you think
Basil can be to you all I tried to be, marry him
after what the world thinks a prudent and fitting
interval. Let no thought of me come between
you and him, save this, that if it seems good to you
to cast your lot with his, I wish you to do so.
You have done your uttermost to give the old
man your love. I know by what I heard last
night that you have not hurt his honour, and I
would in the years to come you should give your
hand where your heart is now. Give it, remembering
that if I had any need to pardon I have
pardoned; that I have done my best to repair
my error, and secure for you freedom from temptation
during my lifetime, and happiness after
my death. I never suspected you; I never spied
upon you; all my knowledge came from others.
The enclosed told me of your intended meeting
with Basil this evening. I leave it for you to see,
as perhaps you may guess who sent it (I cannot),
and be on your watch against a secret enemy
when I am here to guard you no longer. This is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>the last thing I can do for you. God grant it
may turn out for your welfare here and hereafter.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>In the twilight she read it; when the summer
night came, she still sat on thinking with a
terrible despair, with a sickening remorse about
the irreparable past—about the hopeless future.
He had known—he had known how fond she was
of Basil; but he could never know now how fond
she had been of him! And Phemie would have
given all the years of her future life for ten
minutes from the past—ten minutes to explain,
to confess, to weep out her repentance, and then,
if need be, to part.</p>

<p class='c011'>But amid all her grief there was another and
perhaps a stronger feeling—anger against the
person who enlightened Captain Stondon, who
had driven Basil across the seas.</p>

<p class='c011'>She could have fought out her fight alone, she
thought. Had she not done so? She could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>have spoken herself to her husband when she
found the burden of the day too much, the heat
of the battle too fierce. How came it she had
never suspected interference before? How could
she ever have forgiven Miss Derno, and varied in
her opinion concerning her?</p>

<p class='c011'>“She wrote that letter.” Thus Phemie ended
the mental argument. “She fancied she would
get him for herself, and she did not care what
misery she brought to any one else—a double-faced
hypocrite! Well, Miss Derno, you have
played your last game out with me.” And
Phemie folded up the letters, and put them aside
in a drawer, resolving to make no mention of
their contents to any one.</p>

<p class='c011'>She felt wretchedly ill. Her head was burning,
her hands and feet were cold as ice. When
her maid came to know if she would wish her tea
brought up into her dressing-room, she said,
“No,” and bade the woman say to Mr. Aggland
that she desired to see him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Uncle,” she began, when he obeyed the summons,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“I have had a great shock to-night, and I
fear I am going to have a bad illness. Count
that,” and she laid his fingers on her pulse;
“promise me that if I should be delirious you
will get a nurse from London. I do not want
Helen nor any of the servants to come near me,
and, beyond everything, keep Miss Derno away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Whereupon Mr. Aggland went downstairs, and
sending off straightway for a doctor, told Miss
Derno he thought Phemie must be “lightheaded;”
acting upon which information, Miss
Derno went upstairs, and knocked at Mrs. Stondon’s
door, which was opened by Mrs. Stondon’s
maid, who said her mistress had gone to bed
with a bad headache.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is that Miss Derno?” cried out Phemie;
“let her come in—I wish to speak to her; and
you may go away, Marshall. Are you there?”
she exclaimed, as the door closed behind the
woman. “Come near to me. That will do.
Now then, what do you want?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want to know how you are, dear,” said Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Derno, approaching the bed, and trying to take
one of Phemie’s hands in hers, but Phemie
pulled it away.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will be fair and frank with you, Miss
Derno,” she began; “I will speak freely to you
now, as I once thought never to speak freely to
mortal. Within the last few hours I have learnt
all; I have learned who sent Basil Stondon to
India; who told my husband that I—that
he——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That Basil loved you,” supplied Miss Derno,
“If you mean that, I certainly plead guilty; but,
Mrs. Stondon, was I wrong?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wrong or right what business had you to
come between my husband and me?” retorted
Phemie, sitting bolt upright in bed; while the
loosened waves of her hair, that she wore ordinarily
braided so closely under her cap, rippled
down over throat and shoulders and pillows.
“Could you not have left <em>me</em> to deal with Basil
without breaking the heart of as good a man as
ever possessed an unworthy wife?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>“I never told Captain Stondon that I thought
you loved Basil,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But you sent him where he could hear it for
himself,” answered Phemie. “You told him to
go to the pine plantation that night when Basil
and I parted.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here Mrs. Stondon stopped: there seemed to
come around her as she spoke the twilight of the
autumn evening, the moaning of the wind, the
leaves beneath her feet. She could not go on,
and so she paused, while Miss Derno said—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never did—I never even knew till this
moment that Basil and you had a parting interview,
or that Captain Stondon was present
at it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You cannot expect me to believe that,” was
the retort; “you wanted Basil for yourself; you
thought if once he were separated from me,
he would marry you. No means seemed too
treacherous to secure such a prize.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now heaven help the woman!” broke in
Miss Derno. “Mrs. Stondon,” she continued,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>“are you mad? Can you think that I should
scheme to win Basil Stondon? I, who refused
him twice before he ever lost his heart to
you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Hearing that, Phemie fell back on her pillow.</p>

<p class='c011'>If Miss Derno thought to make peace by such
a sentence, she mistook the nature of the woman
she was speaking to.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no balm in Gilead for a wound like
this. To have given her own love, to have
deceived her husband, to have wasted her affection
on a man who had loved another before her!
It seemed like the very bitterness of death, and
Phemie struggled against conviction.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you did not wish to marry Basil; if you
did not write that letter, who did?” she said, half
turning her face towards Miss Derno.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I cannot tell; I cannot be sure, though I may
guess——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is only half an answer,” persisted
Phemie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, then, I guess Georgina Hurlford wrote
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>it. She would have had no objection to become
Mrs. Basil Stondon; and I believe she was
capable of committing any meanness, if by so
doing she could compass her own ends.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment Phemie paused; then she said—</p>

<p class='c011'>“You confess you told my husband Basil cared
for me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do; and I told him so in all honour and
honesty of purpose. I knew you would not tell
him. I saw Basil would never leave Marshlands
of himself, and it was best I did speak to Captain
Stondon. Though going to India cost Basil his
life, it was best for you both that he did go. You
cannot deny the truth of what I am saying.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do deny it,” retorted Phemie, fiercely. “I
would have gone through fire and water; I would
have suffered tortures; I would have died myself
cheerfully before letting him guess the miserable
truth he learnt that night among the pines. It is
no use my making any secret of what you already
know. I tell you, hating you all the time for
your knowledge, that I did love Basil Stondon—God
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>forgive me—more than I ever loved any man
on earth. I loved him, detesting myself for
loving him; I loved him more than my husband,
but I loved my husband better; and because I
loved him better—because he trusted, idolized,
and believed I was as good and true as a wife
ought to be, I had rather have fought my own
battle out to the end. I would rather have borne
twenty times as much as I did bear than that he
should have come to share any part of the trouble
with me. Oh Lord!” finished Phemie, passionately,
“will my punishment never end? Will
there come no day that shall see the last of this
my sin?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mrs. Stondon!” And Miss Derno laid a
beseeching hand on Phemie, but Phemie again
shook it off.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You put division between us—you meddled
in that which did not concern you—you sent
Basil to India—you embittered the last days of
my husband’s life. I know now, I know now,”
she wailed out, “what made him look at me as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>often did, and I will never forgive you, never—if
you were dying this minute I would not—if I were
dying I would not; and I do not believe Basil
ever cared for you much, and I do believe you
wrote that note. If you meddled in one part, why
not in the other?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is of no use, I suppose, striving to argue
with you,” answered Miss Derno. “There is
only one thing I will say, however; not very long
ago you told me you were sorry ever to have
misjudged me. You are misjudging me now,
and you will be sorry for having done so hereafter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall have to bear that sorrow then as I
have had to bear others,” was Phemie’s reply.
“You came here professing to be fond of me—professing
to like me better than any other woman
in the world, and all the time you were scheming
against me and mine; you were trying to put
division between me and my husband; you thought
perhaps nothing would kill him so soon as to tell
him I was too fond of Basil; very likely you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>hoped to get Basil and Marshlands together. I
am saying exactly what I think—I cannot be a
hypocrite, though you are one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mrs. Stondon, I never told any one you
were too fond of Basil, and I never sent Captain
Stondon to any place where he was likely to
hear that fact for himself. What is the cause
of all this excitement? who has been putting
ideas into your mind? from whom have you
heard?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have heard from the dead,” answered
Phemie; “and they, I suppose, may be trusted
to speak the truth. You came spying here,
watching my every word and look and movement,
and then, having somehow guessed the truth, you
went and informed my husband that Basil loved
me. That is on your own confession—out of
your own mouth I convict you. After that you
expect me to believe you did not go further, and
tell him I loved Basil. Do you imagine I am an
idiot? do you think I have lost my senses altogether?
No, no, Miss Derno, there is a point at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>which credulity ceases, and you could never make
me credit Georgina Hurlford wrote that note,
unless I heard it from her own lips.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Which it is not very probable you will do, in
this world at all events,” said Miss Derno; “for
I have not the slightest idea that she is still
living. Let that be as it may, however, I can
only repeat what I have said, I did not try to do
you any harm. I did not desire that Basil should
marry me. I have tried to be your friend, and
though you will not be my friend, I shall never
change to you. Do not let our last word be one
of anger. Good-by.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Phemie only turned her head aside, and
the great mass of her hair was all Miss Derno
could see of her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good-by,” repeated Miss Derno, putting her
hand over Phemie’s shoulder, but Phemie would
take no notice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good-by,” she said for the third time, and
she stooped and kissed the shining tresses which
had first caught Captain Stondon’s fancy. “God
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>knows whether or not we shall ever meet again,
but may He keep and bless you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And turning away she left the room slowly, and
returning to Mr. Aggland, told him his niece was
not at all delirious.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But she has taken offence at something she
fancies I have done,” added Miss Derno; “and
it will be best for me to leave here to-morrow
morning. Do not try to make peace between us;
in time she will discover her mistake, and till
then I can be patient.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br> <span class='c009'>MEETING.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Spring came round again; and Phemie, walking
about the grounds at Marshlands, saw the
crocuses and the snowdrops blooming, the daffodils
rearing their gaudy heads in triumph, the
violets peeping modestly up from amongst their
thick covert of green leaves, and the primroses
blossoming in the hedgerows and beside the wood
paths.</p>

<p class='c011'>In due time the wild hyacinths opened their
blue and white bells, and perfumed the air with a
delicious fragrance; in the copses the wood anemones
shone like stars in shaded places; there
was fresh foliage on the trees, the grass felt soft
and velvety under foot; there was a stir of life
throughout all nature—nature so recently awakened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>from her long winter’s rest. And Phemie, looking
around her—looking back at the years which
were past, and forward at the years which were to
come—thought sadly that for all inanimate nature
there is a spring-time as well as an autumn, but for
man no second youth, no returning April wherein
the flowers of his former existence can blossom
and bloom as of yore.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had passed through grievous sickness since
the night she and Miss Derno parted; she had
suffered mentally and bodily, and she was only
now just crawling out again into the air and the
sunshine, to see what the sweet sights and sounds
of spring could do for her—she whom the world
thought so fortunate a woman.</p>

<p class='c011'>For was not she young, well dowered, well
cared for? She had Roundwood to fall back
upon whenever Marshlands came to be claimed
by its rightful owner. Her husband was dead;
but people said if she could not please herself
again, supposing she desired to do so, who
could?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Society felt it was the proper thing for her to
live in strict seclusion, to receive no visitors, to
be in a poor state of health and in low spirits;
but at the same time society concluded that when
the days of mourning were expired, Mrs. Stondon
would feel that it had been the will of God for
Captain Stondon to die, and that as he was to
die, she ought to be thankful it had likewise been
the will of God to provide her with a satisfactory
portion of this world’s goods.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many people were already making inquiries as
to the amount of personalty Captain Stondon had
left behind him, and how he had disposed of it—whilst
the value of Roundwood was known to a
shilling. Those ladies who had brothers or sons
anxious to marry a wife able to contribute her
share towards the expenses of a household, ventured
finally to remark to Mr. Aggland that they
thought dear Mrs. Stondon was leading too much
the life of a hermit, and that a little society, “not
exactly society, but merely seeing a few intimate
friends, would be extremely good for her.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>To which Mr. Aggland replied, in all truthfulness,
that he thought the shock had been almost
too much for his niece. “They were so much
attached,” he added, “she seems to feel his loss
more and more every day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>(Which was not encouraging to the young
men.)</p>

<p class='c011'>“She will be better perhaps when we get her
away from Norfolk,” went on Mr. Aggland;
“change of scene will, I hope, work wonders. It
is her first great sorrow in life, and you remember,
madam, ‘Every one can master a grief but he
that has it.’ Few are able to say just at the first—‘The
hand of the Lord hath wrought this.’
In time, I have no doubt but that her present
anguish will—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Settle down into a grief that loves</div>
      <div class='line'>And finds relief in unreproved tears;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then cometh sorrow like a Sabbath, and, last</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all, there falls a kind oblivion</div>
      <div class='line'>Over the going out of that sweet light</div>
      <div class='line'>In which we had our being.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“What a wonderful memory you have, Mr.
Aggland,” said his visitor, with a simper; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>then she drove down the avenue, and called at
half-a-dozen houses, and whispered in each of
them—“I do think there must be some little
insanity in Mrs. Stondon’s family. That uncle of
hers is as eccentric and odd as possible. His
brain seems to me a perfect library, or rather a
book filled with familiar quotations.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It did not strike me that they were familiar
at all,” said Mr. Ralph Chichelee; “quite the
contrary, indeed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And, besides,” put in Mrs. Enmoor, who had
rather an affection for Phemie, “he is not her
uncle by blood, only by marriage.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But it is so strange the way she goes on,”
persisted the first speaker; “she sees no one—she
goes out nowhere—she is even ‘not at
home,’ or ‘too ill to receive’ to the clergyman’s
wife.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you not believe she is ill, then?” asked
Mr. Chichelee.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I met her out driving one day last week, and
I am sure she then looked like a ghost,” added
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Mrs. Enmoor. “I was quite shocked to see
her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But she adopts no means to get well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hear she is having that place of hers in
Sussex put into thorough order,” said Mr. Chichelee.
“No doubt she will soon be leaving
Marshlands now; and that reminds me—has
anything been heard of the missing heir?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“People seem convinced he is dead,” was the
reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And who is the fortunate man in that case?”
inquired Mr. Chichelee.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A Mr. Haslett Stondon, I hear,” answered
Mrs. Enmoor; “who was born in Canada—a great
boor, I am told. Ah! Marshlands will never
again be what it was—poor dear Captain Stondon!”
finished Mrs. Enmoor, with grateful reminiscences
of all Phemie had tried to do for her and
hers in that pretty drawing-room which looked out
over the flower-garden, and the walk under the
elm trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was all true—Phemie was going away, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Marshlands would never again be bright and
gay as formerly. Mrs. Stondon had scarcely
realised to herself how much she loved Marshlands
till she was called upon to quit it. Roundwood
might be a very nice property, but it was
not Marshlands. And to leave Marshlands, to
vacate the old familiar rooms in favour of Mr.
Haslett Stondon, a man who openly stated he
should never reside there, and that with all his
heart and with all his soul, and with a good many
oaths into the bargain, he wished she would stay,
as it would save him the expense of a caretaker!</p>

<p class='c011'>Phemie wished so too; but still she could not
continue to live in the house she had owned, as a
mere tenant. It was best for her to effect her
change of residence as speedily as might be, and
try to get over all her troubles at once. The
ray of hope that had illumined her life had faded
away. No tidings came of Basil; there seemed
no reason to doubt but that it was really he who
had died on board the <em>Lahore</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We will leave this and go to Roundwood,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>uncle, before the summer is over,” she said one
day. And Mr. Aggland eagerly assenting—forthwith
preparations for their departure were made,
and bills were posted on every wall and paling in
the neighbourhood, announcing that on the —th
inst. there would be an auction at Marshlands of
household furniture, carriages, stock, farming
utensils, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I intend to have that inlaid cabinet,” said
Mrs. Hurlford to her husband.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I,” answered he, “that roan horse, if he
goes at all reasonable.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It seems strange to me she can bear to sell
the furniture,” remarked soft-hearted little Mrs.
Enmoor, never thinking that Phemie wanted to
have done with all the old associations—that she
wished to forget—to begin an entirely new life in
a new place.</p>

<p class='c011'>When once her own personal effects were off
the premises, Mrs. Stondon meant to proceed to
Roundwood, leaving her uncle to arrange all
other matters for her; and it wanted but a day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>or two of her intended departure when a special
messenger arrived with a letter from Messrs.
Gardner, Snelling, and Co., stating that Mr.
Basil Stondon was alive, that he was in England,
that he might be expected at Marshlands almost
at any hour.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Uncle!” She put the letter into his hands,
and then fell back in a dead faint on the sofa
where she was seated.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My dear child,” Mr. Aggland said, when the
weary eyes opened once more, and rested on the
paper lying on the table, “my poor Phemie, I
must get you away; you must be kept quiet.
These surprises and sudden tidings are killing
you. Those men might have had more consideration,
more sense. You must leave Marshlands.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, as it seemed, speaking almost without
her own will, Phemie cried out—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let me wait and see him—let me see the
dead man alive again, and then take me where
you will, away from this for ever. Let me stay,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>she went on, with earnest pleading, “just to welcome
him back, just to make him feel he has
come home, and I will leave the next hour.”</p>

<p class='c011'>That was her first prayer; her second was to
leave immediately—to have everything packed
up, and ready for immediate departure.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then a new fancy seized her: she would have
all the bills for the auction taken down; she
would have every article of furniture put back in
its place; the mirrors refixed, the pictures rehung,
the curtains re-arranged; there should not
be a chair out of place when the wanderer returned.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My husband would have wished it so,” she
said to Mr. Aggland, and Mr. Aggland gave
orders to have the rooms they had already
vacated put in order, the fatted calf killed, and
the house got ready for the reception of the new
owner.</p>

<p class='c011'>He certainly inclined to the opinion that
Phemie was a little out of her mind. He had
long thought her odd—and now he was confident
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>his niece was not merely odd, but also something
more.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fainting and crying, and having the whole
place upset on account of the return of a man
whom she never could bear—for whom she never
had a civil word!” Mr. Aggland muttered; but
he comforted himself a moment afterwards by
recollecting that—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>“——Good as well as ill,</div>
      <div class='line'>Woman’s at best a contradiction still;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>and thought that perhaps, when all was said and
done, Phemie’s eccentricities were matters not of
mind but of sex.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am not sure that it is good for women to have
their own way,” he reflected; “for if they have
the guiding of themselves they are never content
with one road for two minutes together. Likely
as not, she will want the bills posted again to-morrow,
so I won’t have them taken down at any
rate.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you not think it would be well for you
to send a messenger, begging Mrs. Montague
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Stondon to come down here to receive her son?”
he ventured to propose next morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Am I mistress here now?” Phemie angrily
retorted. “Is the house mine, to ask or to bid
keep away? I ought to be out of Marshlands
at this minute. I shall merely remain to touch
hands with Basil, and bid him welcome home,
and then go when he arrives. Let the luggage be
sent over to Disley, and it will be ready for whatever
train we choose to start by.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I think it most improbable he will be
here for some days; he will naturally remain in
London to see his lawyers and his mother,
and——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Basil Stondon will come straight on to
Marshlands,” she interrupted. “He will not
lose an hour in hastening to—to—take possession
of his property.” And her heart fluttered like a
bird’s as she spoke; while Mr. Aggland answered—</p>

<p class='c011'>“That she seemed to have a high opinion of
Mr. Basil Stondon and of his unselfishness. If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>he will feel no sorrow for your husband’s death,
and only rejoice at your having to leave Marshlands,
why do you remain to receive him, why can
you not travel to Roundwood at once?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because it would seem hard to him—no
matter what he may be—for no creature to be
here to say, ‘I am glad you are alive—God give
you happiness as He has given you wealth.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, suppose I stay here and say all that in
your name?” suggested Mr. Aggland, who had
an intuitive feeling his niece would be better
away. “I can tell him all your wishes—how you
desire that he shall retain the whole or any portion
of the furniture—how the cows and horses,
the sheep and the pigs are his to command, if he
have any liking for any of them—how you have
enough and to spare without stripping the house
of its ornaments. I can say as well as you that
‘there is no winter’ in your generosity; can
prove how good a steward you have been, spending
your own money on another’s land. All that
has occurred here since his departure I can relate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>for his benefit, and I can bring news to you at
Roundwood where and how he has passed the
time during which we have all thought him dead.
Will you take my advice, Phemie, and go? The
memories he will recall, the excitement of seeing
a man risen from the grave, as one may say,
will certainly prove too much for you. Will you
go?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have a fancy to stay, uncle,” she answered;
“just as I said before, to wish him health and
happiness before I leave Marshlands for ever.
Most likely I shall never enter its doors again—let
my last thought of the old home be a gracious
one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And there came such a sad, wistful look into
the sweet face that Mr. Aggland could press the
point no further. He only said it should all be
as she wished, and entreated her to lie down
and recruit her strength, so that when the
journey had to be taken she might be ready
for it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope to see the colour back in your cheeks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>some day, my dear,” he concluded. “We will all
take such care of you when we get you among us
once more, that you shall not have any choice
left but to get well and strong again. With
all your life still before you, it will never
do for you to settle down into a desponding
invalid.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have patience,” Phemie answered; “let me
only get this meeting over—let me once begin a
new existence elsewhere, and I will try to make
a good thing of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you not made a good thing of it?” he
asked; but Mrs. Stondon shook her head.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We will not talk about the past,” she replied;
“the present is enough for us, surely. Let me
go now, uncle,” she added; “I want to be quiet
for a time, quiet and alone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Aggland followed her with his eyes, as she
ascended the staircase. He felt there was something
about Phemie which he could not understand—which
he had never understood—“and
which <em>I</em> probably never shall,” he decided, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>he heard a distant door close behind her. “I
do think she is very odd but somehow very
sweet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Could he have seen what Phemie was doing at
that very moment, he would have thought her
odder still.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was standing before her mirror, looking at
all that was left of the Phemie who had once
been so beautiful; looking at the pale, wan face,
at the sharpened features, at the dark lines under
her eyes, at the lines across her forehead, at her
figure round and symmetrical no longer, at the
ghastly whiteness of her cheeks, at the widow’s
cap which concealed her hair, at the black
trailing dress.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her beauty! Ah, Heaven! that had been a
dream too, and it was gone—like her youth, like
her gaiety, like her pride, like her vanity, like
her innocence of soul—gone for ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>She turned away from the glass, and covered
her face with her hands. She was no heroine,
only a woman; and she could not help mourning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>over the fact that her youth was gone and her
beauty with it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet what had youth and beauty done for her?—what?
Had they not led her into temptation?
Had she not wept such tears, whilst her eyes were
bright, and her face round, and her cheeks blooming,
as she hoped never to shed again till the day
of her death?</p>

<p class='c011'>Had her very loveliness not brought such suffering
upon her as had wrought the wreck she
was? Why should she mourn because she had
no attractions left to charm the man who once
loved her so passionately? Why was it so terrible
to her now to realise the full force of the
truth which had glimmered across her understanding
that night when she sat looking through
the darkness down over Tordale?</p>

<p class='c011'>She had owned one life—on this side of the
grave she could never own another. In the eyes
of the world she had made a very good thing of
it; she had married well, she had associated well,
she had succeeded to the Keller property; her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>husband also had left her abundantly provided
for; she had done well so far as money was concerned,
but for all that Phemie knew, now when
she sat looking—not through the darkness down
upon Tordale, but back through the years to her
girlhood—that her life had been a lost one, that
although there were plenty more lives in the
world still to be lived out and made much of or
spoiled—enjoyed or marred—yet there could be
no second existence for her, no return of the
years, no retracing of her steps, no re-writing the
book, no erasing the past.</p>

<p class='c011'>Do you comprehend at last the story I have
been trying to tell?—the story which has had in
it so little of variety or excitement, but yet that
was after all the tale of a woman’s life—of a
woman who, like the rest of us, whether man or
woman, had but one—and spoiled it! In the
world’s great lottery, as I said early in these
pages, her little investment might seem a mere
bagatelle; but it was the whole of her capital
notwithstanding.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>And she had lost! Looking back, this conviction
forced itself upon her; she had lost, and
it was too late for her to hope for a profit in the
future.</p>

<p class='c011'>Had she hoped? had she still clung to the
idea of that man loving her? had she believed
they might again meet for once, as of old, and
then part? What had she thought? what had
she hoped till she looked critically at herself in
the unflattering mirror?</p>

<p class='c011'>My reader, I cannot tell—though that was an
hour when Phemie tried hard to understand herself,
to comprehend why she had wished to stay—why
she now wished to go.</p>

<p class='c011'>All that passed swiftly and sharply through
her heart, it would be well nigh impossible for
any one to imagine. She could not have told
herself aught save this—that her part was played
out, on a stage where every step had proved
a failure; that there was literally nothing more
left for her to do, save walk behind the scenes,
and leave the ground clear for those who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>still to act out their life’s drama—ill or well, as
the case might be.</p>

<p class='c011'>She rose and stood in the middle of her room
irresolute. Should she go? should she not go?
should she play the hostess in Marshlands for
the last time? remain to greet the new owner
and then pass away like the old year? or should
she follow the bent of her own inclination and
avoid this meeting?</p>

<p class='c011'>Could she bear to see his look when he saw
her changed face? could she assume indifference,
or he forgetfulness?</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will go,” she concluded; and the grey
evening shadows were settling down as this idea
became a fixed determination. “I will go!—better
to seem unkind than to play the fool. My uncle
will wait and welcome him—a fitter one to
do so than I.” And she rang her bell, and
bade Marshall pack the few articles still lying
about, and prepare for their immediate departure.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think we can catch the night express,” she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>said; and she went downstairs to speak to her
uncle about it.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was not in the drawing-room, and while
she remained for a moment irresolute, there
was a noise in the hall as of some one’s arrival.</p>

<p class='c011'>She tried to move forward to the door, but the
blood rushing back to her heart took the power
of movement from her. He had come—he had
come from out of those great waters—from the
grave—out of the past. She forgot the years—she
forgot her widow’s weeds—she forgot the
dead husband lying in the churchyard beyond
the village—she forgot the loss of her beauty—the
time that had passed—she remembered nothing
save this man whom she had loved, and
who had come back again; and when the door
opened she stretched out her arms towards him,
and cried—“Basil—Basil!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, as in a sort of fright, the dead alive,
with a quick glance behind him, answered warningly,
while he advanced to meet Phemie—</p>

<p class='c011'>“And my wife!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>There are times when the very excess of their
fear gives men courage; there are occasions
when the very intensity of the suffering deadens
sensation; and there are also moments in life
when, out of the very depth of the previous humiliation,
there arises sufficient pride to carry
humanity over the most critical moment of its
agony and despair.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such a moment arrived to Phemie then. She
had forgotten her pride—her dead—her resolutions;
she had stretched out her arms with a
great cry of joy to the lost who was found.
Another second, and, God help her! she would
have let him take her to his heart; but, almost
before his name had passed her lips there came
crashing down upon her that cruel warning sentence—</p>

<p class='c011'>“And my wife.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then she saw his wife. Standing behind him
in the doorway, with her bright, mocking eyes
fixed on Phemie’s face, was the woman he had
married.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>She was younger than Phemie; watching had
not paled her cheeks, nor grief wasted her figure.
The mourning dress which made Phemie look
so white and worn and haggard only set off the
other’s beauty to greater advantage; and there
was a malicious satisfaction playing over every
feature, as the new mistress of Marshlands heard
Basil’s remark, and perceived the effect it produced
on Phemie. But next moment Phemie
was mistress of the position.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are welcome!” she said, and she held
out her hand, which neither shook nor faltered,
towards the woman who had supplanted her.
“I have waited here to say this to both of you,
Georgina; waited to wish you health, wealth, and
happiness in Marshlands—before leaving it for
ever.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was like a queen beside the new arrival—like
a queen in her manner, her carriage, her
address; and when she turned and spoke to
Basil, and, looking him straight in the face, told
him—with just that tremor in her voice which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>comes into most voices when people speak of a
great pain endured—of a great peril escaped—how
she had mourned for his reported death—how
she had suffered much suspense and much
sorrow concerning him—how even at that moment
she could scarcely believe it was really to
Basil Stondon, Basil raised from the dead, she
was speaking—she still remained in possession
of the field, and Mrs. Basil Stondon, <i><span lang="fr">née</span></i> Hurlford,
gained no advantage over her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Phemie speaking to Basil never tried to conceal
how much the thought of his death had
affected her; never strove to explain away her
cry at his entrance. She had sustained a
grievous defeat, and yet she mastered her men
so well, she displayed her resources so admirably,
she addressed the wife with so gracious a
courtesy, and the husband with such an earnest
joy and sincerity, that Georgina could scarcely
decide whether, after all, she was not the one
worsted in the encounter—whether the former
mistress of Marshlands had not the best of the day.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>She could not even flatter herself into thinking
her arrival was driving Phemie off the field; for
Phemie’s preparations had all been made before
she knew Basil Stondon had brought a wife back
with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>The departing combatant always, too, seems,
like the Parthian, to be able to leave some stinging
arrow behind him. There is a victory in
the mere act of “going,” the greatness of which
is generally felt, though rarely, I believe, acknowledged.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a grand moral power in walking out
of a room, or driving away from a house, that
produces an effect on the individuals left behind.
It is action—it is force—it is doing what another
person is unable to do. Their intentions are
powerless to detain; the will of the one combatant
has been stronger than that of the other;
and perhaps it was some idea of this kind which
made Mrs. Basil Stondon so earnestly press
Phemie to remain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will not pain us—you will not be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>cruel?” she urged. But Phemie had made all
her arrangements, and was not to be turned
aside from her path.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I stayed but to bid you welcome—you, Basil,
whom I knew were coming, you also, Georgina,
whom I did not expect—it seems I remained to
receive you both. Having done so, let me go,
for this is my home no longer, and no kindness
can ever make it seem home to me again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She passed by them, and walked towards her
uncle. “Is the carriage ready?” she asked;
adding, in an undertone, “For God’s sake let
us get away from here at once!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And still Phemie kept moving forward, and
next moment caught sight of Basil’s child.</p>

<p class='c011'>The nurse was surrounded by a group of
excited domestics, who, standing in the centre
of the hall, were criticising and admiring the
heir, a fine boy, who neither cried nor shrieked,
but kept essaying to talk, and crowing mightily.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are limits to all things, and there were
limits even to Phemie’s self-command. From
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>that group she turned aside and fled, up the wide
staircase, along the corridor, to the room that
had been hers, but which, like all the rest, must
now be abandoned to strangers. She sent away
her maid, she put on her bonnet, she threw her
shawl around her, she took one last look out
over the park, and then hurried away from the
familiar apartment as though a plague were in it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The carriage was at the door, her maid on the
box beside the coachman; Georgina stood at
the hall door, and Basil came out and assisted
Phemie into her brougham. As he did so he
whispered—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wanted to come down alone, but she would
not let me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Mr. Aggland took his seat beside his
niece, and Phemie, leaning forward, bowed a
farewell to Basil and his wife; and the horses
sprang forward down the long avenue and
through the gates, and were soon dashing along
the level road leading to Disley, leaving Marshlands
far behind.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>So long as they were under the shadow of the
pines and the elm-trees, uncle and niece never
exchanged a sentence; but once they were outside
the domain, Mr. Aggland laid his hand
gently on the poor thin fingers which were
knotted and twisted together in a kind of convulsive
agony, and said, “Phemie!”</p>

<p class='c011'>No other word—but at the sound of that she
flung herself on his breast and cried with such a
frenzy of grief that he answered her inarticulate
appeal for comfort with broken words of consolation
and sympathy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t!” she cried—“don’t! I deserve it
all. Let me bear it. Oh, uncle, do you understand
what has been the misery of my life at
last?”</p>

<p class='c011'>What was there to be said—what to be done—what?—but
to secure a compartment all to themselves,
and stow Marshall and the smaller effects
into another. He felt thankful to have caught
the express, even though Sewel’s bays had been
greatly distressed in order to compass that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>desirable end. He knew Phemie’s grief must
have its way; and so he let her lie back and
weep out her trouble as they dashed on through
the night.</p>

<p class='c011'>He did not speak to her. He did not go near
her. She sat in her corner, and he in his; and
they both thought—thought—while the hours
went by. They travelled the same mental course—he
in his way, she in hers. He recalled to
mind the girl who had come to him in his
sanctum to ask his advice, and whom he had
afterwards prayed might never know what it was
really to love.</p>

<p class='c011'>And this was the end. O God! this was the
end. And the man’s eyes were dim with tears
as he bent forward and looked out into the
darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Whilst Phemie!—she was reciting to herself
and preaching out of her own experience a
sermon upon it.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had gone back to Tordale too. She
was sitting—unmarried—unwooed—in that little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>church under the shadows of the everlasting
hills. The man whom she afterwards wedded,
came in at the porch, and entered the pew, and
shared her book, and he was nobody to her
then.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had been dreaming of heroes of romance—lords
and knights and young esquires. And
what was that middle-aged tourist to her? What
concern was he of hers? What meaning
had the text Mr. Conbyr selected for her
either?</p>

<p class='c011'>“The wages of sin is death!” he said. And
Phemie looked down at her faded muslin dress—at
her poor finery—and thought of Lord
Ronald Clanronald while the preacher proceeded.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, the years had gone by. And she
dreamed no more of youths of high degree—of
skirts of green satin—of the great future that
might be in store for her. The old things
regarded then were unheeded now; but the
truth heard so many a long day before came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>home to her fully in the half darkness of that
summer night.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The wages of sin is death!” Had they not
been death to her? death to every pleasant
memory—to every innocent recollection—to every
future hope—to every dream of happiness—to
every plan—to every desire. There was nothing
in her past she could look back to with satisfaction;
there had been flowers, but there was a
blight on them; there had been bright green
foliage, but, behold, the trees were naked and
bare; there had been a fair sunny landscape,
but the clouds had come up, and in lieu of sunshine
there was blackness—instead of rejoicing,
despair.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had given her love to that man—for his
sake she had forgotten her husband, been cruel
to herself. For his sake! Ah! Heaven! and
he had forgotten her—forgotten all her tears—all
her struggles—all her sorrow—and suffered
his wife to come down and see her humiliation.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>Wife and child—wife and child! had now
taken possession of Marshlands. Where she
had been much she was now nothing. Where
she had been exalted she was brought low. Her
day was declining, her reign over. “The wages
of sin is death!” And the woman’s tears flowed
fast.</p>

<p class='c011'>On through the flat Cambridgeshire fields—on
to the point where Hertfordshire and Essex
shake hands—on to the marsh lands, and the
nursery-grounds round and about Water Lane
and Tottenham—on in the glad light of a
summer’s morning across the Lea—and away
within sight of the wooded heights of Clapton
to Stratford and Mile End—and so to Shoreditch.</p>

<p class='c011'>On! she had preached her sermon—she had
conned her lesson. She had dried her eyes, and
was looking over the fields and the river—over
the house-tops and the sea of red-tiled roofs, at
the life on which she was going to enter.</p>

<p class='c011'>The hour before dawn is always the darkest;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>and that night was probably the blackest, in its
deep despair, which Phemie Keller ever passed
through.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet with the dawn came light; and this was
the beam of sunshine which stole in on Phemie
Keller’s life—Duty.</p>

<p class='c011'>Were there no sick to tend—no poor to visit—no
sorrowing ones to comfort—no children to
educate?</p>

<p class='c011'>Though she had erred she would yet try to
do whatever work her hand found to do.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will not sit down in idleness, uncle,” she
said. “I have sinned—I have suffered—but I
will try——”</p>

<p class='c011'>And as the train, with a shriek and a whistle,
steamed into Shoreditch Station, her uncle bent
down and kissed her hand with an intense pity,
with an unutterable sympathy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Employment is nature’s physician,’ says
Galen,” he remarked. “God in His mercy
grant that it may bring you back to health.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I mean to try,” she repeated; and she drew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>her veil over her face, and passed out, with
the bright sunlight of that summer’s morning
streaming on her, into the deserted London
streets.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V.<br> <span class='c009'>RECONCILED.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>It was the height of the season at Hastings;
the yearly heaven of lodging-house keepers had
arrived; they could be firm about rent, linen,
the use of plate, boot-cleaning, and kitchen fires;
the millennium of temporal prosperity had, after
months of weary waiting, come at last, and the
reign of the saints by the sea-side had begun.
As for the sinners, they had a terrible time of it.
At what hour they should eat; the Spartan
nature of the cookery they might expect; the
rooms wherewithal they must needs content
themselves; these things were announced to
them by the powers in the ascendant with a
severe composure.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>Any man who had all his life entertained an
idea that he was entitled for his money to
money’s worth, needed but to set foot in Hastings
to be undeceived.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the harvest time; and all the native
population of Hastings—under the Castle of
Hastings, on a level with the Castle, of St.
Leonards-on-Sea, and the various regions lying
back from the shore, but still studded with villas
and terraces—put in the sickle.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Egyptians had come down to the sea-side,
and the householders forthwith set about considering
how they should best spoil them. Rents
were doubled—extras were put on—items were
run up—bells were not answered—servants were
harassed to death—every dwelling was crammed,
from basement to garret—cooks were arrogant—housemaids
breathless—and still the cry went
on, “They come!”—and still the place got fuller
and fuller; and it was, as I have said, the height
of the season in Hastings the romantic.</p>

<p class='c011'>Was there ever a prettier bathing-place?—was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>there ever a more charming dwelling for a short
time? Was there ever a town round and about
which there were to be found lovelier walks and
drives—sweeter bits of rural scenery—more enchanting
views over the great sea?</p>

<p class='c011'>Most people seemed to have thought Hastings
perfection that year, for they came flocking to it
as cattle go down into a pond to drink.</p>

<p class='c011'>They came—the autocrats of the fashionable
and the would-be fashionable world—to St.
Leonards, to the great houses fronting the sea,
to Warrior Square, to the little houses up back
streets, and to the terraces, hung up so high
that ordinary limbs ached before the temporary
home was reached.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then there were old-fashioned folks who
affected Hastings—who thought the old town
seemed more home-like and pleasant than the
new—who brought their money to spend within
easy walk of the East Cliff—who loved the roads
leading away to Fairlight—and the old churches
in the High Street—and who declared the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>bathing was better at Hastings than at St.
Leonards.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anyhow, Hastings and St. Leonards were full—too
full for comfort; but not too full for
amusement to anyone who knew London and its
people well.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the country squire, to the grand folks who,
by reason of their great wealth and greater
gentility, are far removed from all the pleasures
of watching their commoner fellows and trying
to understand their ways, these sea-side places
must seem, as a rule, stale, flat, and unprofitable.
It is the naturalist who loves to note the habits
and instincts and modes of existence of the commonest
animal; the bees going and coming—the
ants busy at work—the mole heaps in the garden:
the eccentricities of toad life have no charm to
anyone who does not understand something of
the nature of bee, or ant, or mole, or toad: and
in like manner, the person who does not comprehend
the modes of life and habits of thought of
the men and the women he sees around him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>cannot reasonably be expected to take much
interest in observing their peculiarities.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are those, however, who ask no better
enjoyment than watching Jones, Brown, and
Robinson out for a holiday; who delight in
tracing Jones to his clique, and Brown to his,
and Robinson to his; who luxuriate among
snobs; who, watching them staring out of the
windows at St. Leonards, or airing themselves in
the balconies at Robertson Terrace, or lounging
up and down the Parade, or adventuring their
necks on the backs of much-enduring horses, can
classify the swell, the millionaire, the fortune-hunter,
the pretender, the distant relation of
some great house, the newly rich, the poor man
of family, to a nicety.</p>

<p class='c011'>And behold! there are all the men, women,
and children he has become so familiar with in
the course of his walks and residences round
London.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is Paterfamilias, drearily promenading
with Materfamilias, and making believe to enjoy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>a holiday, which is a continual anxiety, and, as
the poor man feels, an unwarrantable expense.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the whole of his married life he has never
before seen so much of his children, and he
never—heaven forgive him!—wants to see so
much of them again. He is tired of the objectless
days passed in the unexciting society of the wife
of his bosom and of his numerous progeny. On
the whole, he wishes the holiday were over, and
he back at business once again; while Materfamilias
wages war with the landlady, and is
pathetic concerning the price of meat.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are the young ladies from No. 7, who
will go out in the yacht twice a day, together
with a friend, who has invariably to be relanded,
if the sea proves rough, amidst the pity of the
passengers and the secret maledictions of the
crew. There is young Tomkins, the corn-factor,
taking great airs upon himself, walking in sandboots
along the Parade, and staring in the face of
every woman he meets; there is his future
father-in-law, driving out his better-half in one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>of those pony-carriages that are a cross between
a clothes and a plate basket, and charioteering the
safest and most docile of ponies, who could not
run away if he would—as Alexander might have
been supposed to manage Bucephalus, had that
animal ever been harnessed to a modern dog-cart.
In all Hastings there is nothing more amusing
than to watch these amateur whips, who hold the
reins wide apart, and with great skill manage to
keep a firm grasp on the whip at the same time.</p>

<p class='c011'>No young blood tooling his four-in-hand along
the high road ever felt grander than a regular
cockney at Hastings seated behind a slowly-trotting
pony <i><span lang="fr">en route</span></i> to Crowhurst.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have often wondered what the ponies say to
each other about their hirers when they get back
to their chaff and their oats at night. Do they
take any part of the hauling and mauling out in
sneers and sarcasms?—do they curse the day
when basket-carriages were invented?—do they
make lamentation over their weary legs and
roughly-handled mouths?—do they tell about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>how they are cantered up hill and rattled down?—do
they scoff at the hundred weights of flesh
they have had to pull about?—do they recount
their experiences, and do they, as a rule, consider
mankind a mistake?</p>

<p class='c011'>And as for the riding-horses—for the galled
backs, for the broken winds—for the way they
are mauled about, and pulled from side to side
and harassed with curbs—and men who do not
know what to do with either bridle or whip—and
women who will hang on their crutches—and
equestrians generally, who seem to think horses
machines, incapable of weariness or aching bones—what
shall we say of all this?—what of the
great people who drive about in their own carriages,
languidly surveying the commonalty
through eye-glasses?—what of the little people
who walk up and down for hours and go to the
beach to pick up shells, and sit on the benches
and listen to the music?—what of the lonely
men and the solitary women?—what of the excursionists
who come down from London to stay for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>one day, and are taken back at a single fare, and
who eat more apples, pears, and plums, and drink
more beer in that time than an inexperienced
person might deem possible?—what of the nobs
who come down here, for any purpose, as it would
seem, judging from their faces, save pleasure?—what
of the snobs, who ape the airs of the nobs,
and enjoy themselves little accordingly?—what
of the lawyer you have known so well in London,
who mounts to the very top of the East Cliff, and
lies down on the grass there, far away from men
and the noise thereof—lies down, not to think,
or to look, or to dream, but to rest!—what of the
invalid, who gazes out from shaded window at the
changing groups upon the shore?—what of the
children and the nursemaids, of the lovers and
the newly married, of the childless and the
widowed? What? Dear reader, go to Hastings,
and look upon them all for yourself; go,
as Mrs. Stondon did, and yourself a dispassionate
observer, look over the throng.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was in the height of the season that Phemie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>found herself in Hastings once again, and the
waves broke against the Parade, and the sea kept
up its perpetual murmur, and the wind went
sobbing away out upon the waters just as she could
remember it doing in the days that were gone.</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not come to Hastings as a visitor.
She took no furnished apartments. She had to
listen to no dissertations on the subject of plate,
linen, and boot-cleaning. She was in Hastings
for a purpose, not for any pleasure. She had
come quickly, and she meant to return without
delay; for which reasons she and Mr. Aggland
took up their quarters at the hotel which stands
at the east end of Robertson Terrace.</p>

<p class='c011'>Seated by the window, straining her eyes out
over the sea, Phemie went back over the years
that had elapsed since she first beheld the Castle,
the Parade, the East and West Cliffs.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had come to Hastings to see an old friend
who was mixed up with every sad memory of her
life. Of all places Hastings was, perhaps, the
one she would most have shrunk from revisiting;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>but necessity is a hard taskmaster, and necessity
had brought Mrs. Stondon back to the sea, to
the visitors, to the music, to the moonlight once
again.</p>

<p class='c011'>She wanted to see Miss Derno. On her arrival
at Roundwood, immediately after her hurried
departure from Marshlands, her first act was to
inquire at what time the post went out; her next
to write a letter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Writing letters being an employment to which,
at this present age of the world, men and women
are much addicted, the fact of Phemie inditing
an epistle before she rested or refreshed herself
would scarcely be worth mentioning, had it not
chanced that the missive in question was one
over which she wept many tears and breathed
many sighs.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a confession that she had been wrong,
that she had been guilty of grievous injustice; it
contained expressions of deep regret; it concluded
with an earnest prayer for forgiveness.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the main Phemie was of a just and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>generous nature. She never spared herself, and
she could not let the sun set, after her discovery
of Basil’s marriage, till she acknowledged that
Miss Derno’s suspicions of Georgina had been
correct, that her own suspicions of Miss Derno
had been wrong.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had let Basil Stondon come between her
and everything she most esteemed and valued;
between herself and her husband; between herself
and her family and her friends; between
herself and purity; between herself and God.</p>

<p class='c011'>And fully aware of all this, in her deep self-abasement,
in the first agony of her mortified
pride and vanity, with the first smart of the
dreadful wound spurring her on, with the past
spread open before her like a book, Phemie wrote
such a letter to her old friend as caused Miss
Derno, when at length it reached her, to mourn
with an exceeding sorrow for the misery of the
woman whom she had first met so young, so
guileless, so shy and unsophisticated.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had always loved Phemie; loved her spite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>of her faults, her whims, her injustice, her variableness;
and she tried, when she answered the
letter, to convey some assurance of this love to
Mrs. Stondon.</p>

<p class='c011'>The letter had been forwarded to her by Mrs.
Hurlford. She said—“I would have answered
it in person, but I am ill, dear, and I cannot go
to you. I hear your health is far from good, or
I would pray you to come and see me. If you
are strong enough to travel here, I should like to
see you, as it is scarcely probable I shall ever be
able to leave Hastings again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>That was the errand which brought Mrs.
Stondon to Hastings, to see her old friend, to
look in her face, and touch her hand once more.
That! Phemie sat and thought about it, till at
length, turning to her uncle, she said—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think she must be back by this time.
Shall we go and see?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He took his hat in silence, and they passed
out of the hotel side by side. The radiant
beauty of old was gone, and yet many a man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>turned to look after the fair widow as she swept
along the Parade, turning her eyes neither to
right nor to left, but looking straight forward,
like one who sees something away in the indefinite
distance.</p>

<p class='c011'>They had inquired at the house in Robertson
Terrace where Miss Derno lived, if she were
come in, but the servant said she had not yet
returned.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very likely, ma’am, she is on the Parade.
She generally goes out about this time in a Bath-chair,
to listen to the music and to watch the
tide coming in.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Along the Parade, therefore, Phemie walked,
as I have said, with her black dress trailing
behind her, with her eyes fixed on every advancing
group, on every approaching figure.</p>

<p class='c011'>There had been a time when on that same
Parade she felt dreamily, dangerously happy;
and as she walked along, the past was very
present with her, and the woman’s heart bled,
remembering the sweetness of the hours gone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>by, and contrasting that sweetness with the bitterness
of the hours which were then passing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lonely and widowed, childless and deserted,
with the man who had loved her so truly dead,
with the man whom she had loved so passionately
married to another woman, whose son would
hereafter be master of Marshlands—no wonder
that the people who looked admiringly at Phemie’s
stately walk, and turned back for another glance
at her queenly figure, felt instinctively that the
widow’s dress, that the sweeping garments,
covered a sorrowful story; that the new comer
had wept bitter tears, kept weary vigils, passed
through much sorrow, and seen bitter suffering.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was an old actor now on the stage which
she had once regarded from afar off as a mere
spectator; she had gone through the tragedy,
she had played out the most important scenes
in her own life, and she listened to the moaning
and murmuring of the sea with a comprehension
clear and distinct of its meaning.</p>

<p class='c011'>She felt that although she might still have to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>appear on the boards of existence, and act in
other men’s pieces, appear in the comedies and
tragedies of other people’s lives, still that her
own was over.</p>

<p class='c011'>At thirty her spring-time and her summer
were gone. They had not been sunshiny or
genial seasons to her; and the early blossoms
which might have brought forth fruit in the
autumn had died away and withered and rotted,
and the rain had beaten down her roses, and
withered the buds of promise, and cankered the
root of every pleasant flower.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her wounds were fresh, and Phemie felt them
opening again with every step she took. There
was not a foot of all that place but she knew and
loved. There was not a spot of ground round
which there did not hover some memory of the
olden time. She could remember the airs and
the waltzes they had listened to in the days
before Basil went over the sea. She could recollect
where they sat watching the waves come
rushing up on the shore; the sight of the East
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Cliff standing out against the sky affected her
like a sudden pain.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had rejoiced here and she had lamented—she
had been happy while he walked by her
side—she had hearkened to the moaning of the
sea—to the voices of the night when they came
evening after evening and spoke to her—through
the whole of the winter she passed at Hastings
with her husband—about the depths wherein she
then thought Basil was lying.</p>

<p class='c011'>Was his death one half so bitter as his resurrection?
Was it not easier for her to mourn
him dead than behold him lost to her? Yet—no—no—the
woman’s love was stronger than the
woman’s pride. Life for him—life at any price—at
any suffering to herself. He would be
happy and she could bear; and she looked out
seaward as she thought this, and the waves came
murmuring gently up on the shore—gently and
peacefully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Phemie, I think this is Miss Derno.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was Mr. Aggland who spoke, pointing to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>lady seated in an invalid-chair, which was turned
so as to catch the rays of the setting sun, that
were streaming over town and castle, over cliff
and sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Derno—surely not!” exclaimed Phemie,
“That skeleton Miss Derno!” And she went forward
doubtingly, and looked in the sick woman’s
face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mrs. Stondon!”—“Miss Derno!”—they
exclaimed at the same moment, and the two had
met once more.</p>

<p class='c011'>That was no place for loving greeting, for
tender inquiry, for affectionate discourse; and it
was not till Miss Derno had been wheeled back
to her lodgings, and, assisted by a gentleman
who was introduced to Mrs. Stondon as Major
Morrice, had walked into the house, that the
friends could speak to one another—heart to
heart, and soul to soul.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Forgive me, dear!”—that was the burden of
Phemie’s entreaty.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have nothing to forgive,” was the reply;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“and I am so glad—so glad to see you again—to
have you near me before I go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are not dangerously ill though, darling,
are you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mrs. Stondon”—Miss Derno raised the head
which was resting in her lap, and bade Phemie
look in her face—“do you think I am much like
a woman who has long to live?” she asked,
earnestly. “And I have so wished to live—so
wished it, God forgive me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then in the quiet twilight, while the sound of
voices floated to them from the Parade—while
the music rose and fell—while the visitors
walked up and down—while the feet of many
people hurried by—while the moon rose over the
East Cliff—while the waves came washing up on
the shore, and the sound of the waters fell on the
ear like a subdued accompaniment to the noisy
melody of human fears and hopes which was
still being sung on the strand, just the same as
formerly, Miss Derno told the story of her life to
Phemie.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>It was the old story of a mutual love which
yet could not end in marriage—of a rich father
desirous that his only son should marry well,
and unwilling for him to choose beauty and
goodness and youth when money formed no part
of the lady’s dower.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the old story of the girl who would not
endanger her lover’s worldly prosperity—who
would not let him be pauperised for her sake.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the old story of rings exchanged, of
vows breathed, of an engagement entered into, of
eternal constancy promised—then they parted.
He went to India, she remained with her aunt.</p>

<p class='c011'>After that there was foul play; she was represented
to her lover as faithless, as married, as
happy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My letters never reached him, his letters
never reached me,” she proceeded; “and though
I knew, though I was confident there had been
treachery somewhere, still I could not go on
writing when I got no reply. A woman cannot
force herself on a man,” said Miss Derno, with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>slight return of the light, easy manner which
Phemie had so much admired in former days.
“Even if she believes he wants her, it is a
difficult matter for her to press so valuable a
possession on his acceptance—I could not, at all
events. How was I to know the falsehoods he
was told concerning me, and unknowing, I argued,
‘If he wants me he will come back for me; he
will come back some day.’ And he has come
back,” she finished, “to find me the wreck you
see.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was Major Morrice then——?” began
Phemie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was my first love and my last,” said the
dying woman, and the tears came into her eyes
and rolled down her cheeks as she spoke. “I
could have married often,” she went on. “I say
it in no spirit of idle vanity, but merely to show
that I did not remain faithful, as many a woman
does, simply because she has had no chance of
being otherwise than faithful—I could have married
often, I could have married well, as the world
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>talks about such things, but the love of my youth
was the love of my life, and I could take no
second love into my heart for ever. He has never
been in England since we were parted till now.
He would not have come back yet, only that his
father is dead, and there were many things requiring
his presence. He returned at the same time
as Basil Stondon; they were fellow-passengers in
the steamer, and they landed together at Southampton.
From Basil he heard I was not married,
that I had always remained true, and he came to
me here—came to pray me at last to be his wife.
Think of it—think after the years of waiting, and
to have to die and leave him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She covered her face with her hands, and sobbed
aloud, while Phemie said, gently—</p>

<p class='c011'>“And can nothing——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing can save me,” added Miss Derno,
completing her friend’s sentence, “and I am not
going to fight against the unconquerable—I am
not going to try to avert the inevitable. Nothing
worse can come to me than the look I saw on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Gordon Morrice’s face when we first met. My
fate was reflected there as in a glass. He has
learned to disguise his thoughts since that—to
speak hopefully of the future, but I know—I
know——”</p>

<p class='c011'>And she turned her head towards the window,
and looked out at the groups standing on the
Parade, at the young girls walking up and down,
squired by attentive cavaliers. Her life had been
full like theirs once—full of bliss and joy and
happiness—full as the tide at its highest; but
now the waves were ebbing, ebbing, leaving the
sands of time, receding from the green shores of
earth, rolling back—slowly, surely—into the
depths of the mysterious sea.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI.<br> <span class='c009'>THE LAST ENEMY.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>It did not require any very great amount of
pressing to induce Miss Derno to exchange her
lodgings in Robertson Terrace for rooms at
Roundwood. She was ready enough to make the
attempt, at all events, for there is something in
human nature which rebels at the idea of dying
among strangers, and paying extra rent for a
death.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall only be a burden and a trouble to
you,” she said, in answer to Phemie, “only be a
nuisance in your house—you had better leave me
where I am.” But still her eyes belied her lips;
they looked wistfully at Mrs. Stondon, while she
replied—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>“I had not better leave you, and I will not. It
is but little I can do for you now, but let me have
the satisfaction of doing that little. Say you will
come—it is all I ask, we will manage everything
else, if only you can bear to leave Hastings and
come with us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I have so many belongings,” hesitated
the other; “my cousin, and maid, and—and—have
you mentioned the matter to Major Morrice?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, and he has agreed to make Roundwood
his head-quarters for the present too,” answered
Phemie, cheerfully; but as she said this, Miss
Derno looked first in the sweet face bent down
over her, and then turned away and sighed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Would it ever come to that?—when she was
lying cold and dead—would Gordon Morrice grow
in time to love Phemie, and would Phemie learn
to love him? The possibility of such a result
flashed upon the poor invalid’s mind in a moment;
and if tears did blind her eyes, who can wonder?</p>

<p class='c011'>She had loved the man, and he could never be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>anything to her now; but another might be much
to him, and if that other should be Mrs. Stondon,
why better Mrs. Stondon than anyone else, for
then her memory would not quite pass away;
they would think of her sometimes in the quiet
eventide—remember the woman who had loved
them both.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is many an idea that seems unpleasant
enough at first, which yet grows, as time passes
by, familiar and agreeable; the face of a possible
contingency appears strange when it looks in
suddenly through the windows of our soul, but by
degrees that strangeness wears off, and we become
accustomed to its presence, and should miss it
were it to leave its wonted place.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our plans and our ideas come to seem to us
finally like friends; we sketch them, we fill them
in, we add a touch here, make some improvement
there, and then, when we have finished and perfected
them, we cannot bear to part with our
ideals—cannot endure that the touch of reality
should level our dream-castles with the ground.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Miss Derno found this to be the truth, at any
rate. At first the idea of Phemie and Gordon
Morrice growing near and dear to one another
disturbed and troubled her; but as the days went
by—as she beheld the objectless routine of Mrs.
Stondon’s life—as she saw how the sorrows she
had passed through were graven on her heart—how
deep the iron had entered into her soul; as
she watched her flitting hither and thither, anticipating
every want of her sick visitor, and moving
heaven and earth to compass her recovery, Miss
Derno began to hope—she who had done with
hope in this world for herself—that some day
Phemie might marry Gordon Morrice, and put the
irremediable past, with its sin, its suffering, its
repentance, away from her like a garment which,
having been worn, is laid aside for ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>That Phemie should not marry again—that in
the very prime of her life she should thrust hope
and love and joy aside—that she should live for
other people’s children, and preside over a desolate
and lonely household, seemed to Miss Derno
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>terrible, and she took many an occasion to talk
to Mrs. Stondon about the past and about the
future, trying her mind on various subjects, but
finding that only two strings in the instrument
returned their full tone to her delicate touch.</p>

<p class='c011'>She would speak fully about the past, about
her husband, about—well, there is no use in
standing over nice in the terms one employs—her
lover; repentance, and affection; her regret
for her husband, her regard for Basil.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why should I tell you any falsehood about the
matter?” Phemie said, one day; “it is all dead
and gone—the love, the shame, the struggle, the
remorse. I did love Basil Stondon, but I love
him no longer; the moment I saw his wife I was
cured, and being cured, I wonder how any man
can love another man’s wife. I could not love
another woman’s husband. I could not,” she
repeated, seeing a look of incredulity in Miss
Derno’s face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And yet you say you have done with life?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What has that to do with the matter?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>“Much. No person has done with life till
he has met with some fatal disappointment in
it. If you shut yourself up here, seeing no
one, visiting no one, receiving no one, not even
your intimate acquaintances—both Basil and
his wife will be apt to think you are a disappointed
woman, and after a while the world may
think so too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What would you have me do?” Phemie
inquired.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would have you act as if your life were
before, not behind you; as though there were
still some happiness left in existence, even though
Basil be married, and Georgina mistress of
Marshlands. I would not have you leave the
world and take a kind of social veil, burying
yourself among these cousins of yours, and forgetting
that a woman of property has scarcely
a right to reside in such strict privacy as you
propose. When your time of mourning is over,
go out, see people, visit, take an interest in
what is going on around you, and you will find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>as the years pass that happiness comes with
occupation, and that the worst remedy in the
world for a wound is always to be keeping your
hands upon it and pulling the sore open.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have occupied myself,” Phemie answered.
“I have planned schools. I have visited the
poor. I have relieved the sick. I have devoted
myself to my family.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My dear Mrs. Stondon, you must do more.
You must amuse yourself. You must devote
yourself to the good work of getting strong,
mentally and bodily; of taking joy out of the
days as they come and go; of being interested—really
interested—in your fellows. Do it at first
from pride. Put it out of anyone’s power to
say Mrs. Stondon is a broken-hearted and a
disappointed woman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That can never be said with any truth of
me,” answered Phemie, “for I am not disappointed,
and I am not broken-hearted; and if
Basil had never seen Georgina Hurlford, it would
not have made any difference between us. After
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>that—after that letter, I would never marry any
one—I never would.” And Phemie covered her
face with her hands, and sobbed aloud.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What letter are you talking about?” asked
Miss Derno.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am talking of the one my husband left for
me. I will show it to you. I have never shown
it before to any person.” And Mrs. Stondon
rose and left the room, returning in a few minutes,
however, with the letter, which has previously
been copied into these pages.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Read that,” she said, “and never speak again
as if I could marry a second time. Oh! if I
had but known; if I had but known!”</p>

<p class='c011'>If she had but known! Ah, Phemie, not
alone by you have those words been spoken.
Tremblingly, despairingly, when it was too late,
white lips have murmured that sentence—faltering
tongues uttered it hopelessly.</p>

<p class='c011'>If she had but known! Is not that the burden
of most human lamentations, of most mortal
regret? What might we not all, men and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>women alike, have made of our lives, which
are now past and gone, squandered and lost
to us, if we had but known—oh, God! if we had
but known!</p>

<p class='c011'>Silently Miss Derno folded up the letter and
gave it back to her friend. Quietly and thoughtfully
she looked out at the landscape which lay
before her, clad in its autumn robes of gold and
russet, of red and brown, then she said—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Phemie—let me call you Phemie—if he
could speak to you now, he would bid you be
happy; and you will try to be happy for our
sakes—for his and for mine—for love of your
dead husband and your dead friend.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will try.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And supposing, Phemie, that in the future
some good and faithful man should come, praying
you to be his wife, and that you hesitate whether
to say yea or nay, will you think of this letter and
of me, and remember that both told you it would
be no treachery to those you loved in the past
for you to be happy in the future?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Then in a moment Phemie’s grief broke out
again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will have it, then?” she said. “Well,
then, you shall, only never mention the matter to
me more. If I had loved less, I should have
suffered less. Basil Stondon was so dear to me,
that no man could ever win my heart again.
This is the simple truth; and it is the truth,
also, that I would not marry Basil Stondon were
he single to-morrow, and came praying to me—praying
as——”</p>

<p class='c011'>She could not finish her sentence. The
memory of all he had prayed—of the grief he
had tried to bring upon her—of all the shame he
had striven in his selfish recklessness to compass—rushed
in a full tide through Phemie’s heart,
and choked her utterance.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She will think differently some day,” Miss
Derno mentally argued; but the sick woman felt
disappointed, nevertheless. She would have liked
to join their hands, to speak out fully to both of
them, to bid them be happy, yet not quite forgetful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>of her, and then, as such was God’s will,
to go.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not to be, however; though Phemie
grew to like Major Morrice greatly, though he
learned to watch her coming and going and made
such inquiries as induced Miss Derno to believe
he suspected the truth, so far at least as Basil
Stondon was concerned—it was not to be. The
sick woman’s disease went on apace, but never a
bit nearer to one another came the pair. The
months went by—it was the dead time of the year,
the days were dull and dark, and the roll of the
sea as it came in on the shore could be heard all
the night long at Roundwood. There were many
storms, and it was a trying season altogether—trying
even to those in health, to the dwellers in
great cities, and doubly trying to the ailing and
dying far away in the country, who had nothing
to do save think about their ailments, and nothing
to look at save nature dressed in her deepest suit
of mourning.</p>

<p class='c011'>At last the year turned: and one day,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>when the sun came struggling forth, Phemie
said—</p>

<p class='c011'>“We shall soon have spring here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish I might live to see it—oh, I wish I
might,” answered Miss Derno.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, surely, dear, you have no expectation
of leaving us so soon?” Mrs. Stondon began;
but a look in her friend’s face made her stop and
hesitate. “I had hoped,” she went on, “that
the mild weather would do you good—that we
perhaps might go abroad—and——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, Phemie love, you must go abroad alone;
only I wish I might live till the spring. I think
I should go away more certain about the next
world if I could only once again see the flowers
springing and the leaves budding in this.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Greatly Miss Derno took, in those days, to Mr.
Aggland. He could supply her with a verse or
an extract at any instant. He had the whole
Bible almost off by heart, and was able to finish
out whatever thought was trembling through
her mind with text and quotation.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Sometimes Phemie would say, half-reproachfully,
“I think you like better to have my uncle
with you than me.” To which Miss Derno was
wont to reply,</p>

<p class='c011'>“You know you do not believe what you are
saying; but still it is very pleasant to have everything
put into shape for one in a moment. There
is not a thought crosses my mind, not a doubt
perplexes me, but I find the same thought has
occupied and the same doubt perplexed some
other human being long before I was born. Your
uncle makes me not feel so lonely in my mind,
Phemie—that is the secret of my liking to have
him near me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And it was but natural that this should be so—that
the texts, the quotations, the scraps of
poetry, the verses of pathetic songs should, as
Miss Derno said, render the mental road she was
travelling less solitary and weary.</p>

<p class='c011'>Long time had passed since Mr. Aggland led
the quire at Tordale, and his voice was not so
true or full as formerly; but still, in the evenings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>the invalid loved to lie and listen to the
hymns and the songs with which his memory was
stored.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is one thing to hear religious and serious
subjects spoken of at great length, till the brain
grows weary and the mind wandering—to have a
full meal forced upon weak digestion at stated
intervals—and another to have the cup of refreshment
touch the lips whenever they are parched
and feverish.</p>

<p class='c011'>When there is too much thrust upon the
patient the power of assimilation ceases, and the
food which was intended to nourish turns to
poison in the system; and, more especially when
the act of dying is spread over a long period, the
sufferer wearies of the constant recurrence to
spiritual topics and longs for rest—longs for
time to think out one fact ere another is placed
before him for consideration.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was Miss Derno’s case at all events. She
could not have borne any one beside her who
would constantly have been praying or constantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>reading. This excitement, beneficial doubtless
in some cases, would have driven her distracted;
but she loved to talk in the evenings to Mr.
Aggland on those subjects which had always
dwelt next to his heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had thought under the shadow of the everlasting
hills about that land “where sorrow
cometh never.” Walking round his farm, he had
reflected on many things besides wheat and
turnips, sheep and harvest time. He had considered
his life, and felt, though at the period
Carlyle was as a sealed book to him, life was no
idle dream, but a solemn reality—his own—all,
as the great writer says, “he had to front
Eternity with.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A man of this nature was just the person Miss
Derno needed to be near her in the hour of her
bitterest trial: one who could remind her that
“God is better than his promise, if He takes
from man a long lease and gives him a freehold
of a greater value;” who never remained silent
for lack of words, as so many of us do, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>could always fit in the right sentence in the right
place; whose “mynde to him a kyngdome was,”
and who felt himself monarch over every idea it
contained.</p>

<p class='c011'>Who was more fitted to remind the dying
woman that “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
to-day, and for ever?” Who could better bring
in the quotation, “Religion troubles you for an
hour—it repays you by immortality?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Did she shrink from the path before her—he
was able to quote Moir—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When spectral silence pointeth to decay,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>How preacheth wisdom to the conscious breast?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Saying—‘Each foot that roameth here shall rest.</div>
      <div class='line'>To God and Heaven, Death is the only way.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Were she wavering and doubtful, he would
say—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in26'>“Oh! my friend,</div>
      <div class='line'>That your faith were as mine—that thou couldst see</div>
      <div class='line'>Death still producing life, and evil still</div>
      <div class='line'>Working its own destruction—couldst behold</div>
      <div class='line'>The strifes and tumults of this troubled world</div>
      <div class='line'>With the strong eye that sees the promised day</div>
      <div class='line'>Dawn through this night of tempest.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>He could assure her, when she felt loth to leave
the world—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“That there is nothing beautiful in this,</div>
      <div class='line'>The passioned soul has clasped—but shall partake</div>
      <div class='line'>Its everlasting essence—not a scent</div>
      <div class='line'>Of rain-drench’d flower, nor fleece of evening cloud</div>
      <div class='line'>Which blended with a thought that rose to heaven,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall ever die.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Never weary was he of talking about the fair
land where—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Unbroken droop the laden boughs, with heavy fruitage bent;</div>
      <div class='line'>Of incense and of odours strange, the air is redolent;</div>
      <div class='line'>And neither sun, nor moon, nor stars dispense their changeful light,</div>
      <div class='line'>But the Lamb’s eternal glory, makes the happy city bright.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Never did he tire when his theme was of that
City “whose inhabitants no census has numbered;
through whose streets rush no tides of
business; that city without grief or graves—sins
or sorrows; whose walls are salvation, and whose
gates are praise.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Softly, in the firelight, while she leaned back
in her chair, and listened to his voice, he would
recite—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>“There is rest without ony travaille,</div>
      <div class='line'>And there is pees without ony strife,</div>
      <div class='line'>And there is bright sommer ever to see,</div>
      <div class='line'>And there is never winter in that countrie,</div>
      <div class='line'>And there is great melody of angels’ songe,</div>
      <div class='line'>And there is preysing Him amonge,</div>
      <div class='line'>And there is alle manner friendship that may be,</div>

      <div class='line'>And there is wisdom without folye,</div>
      <div class='line'>And there is honestie without vileneye.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Was she timorous—“Death,” he assured her,
“is but a shadow from the rock eternity.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But why multiply examples? why go on to tell
at greater length how the whole burden of his
discourse was—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“But since our souls’ now sin-obscured light</div>
      <div class='line'>Shines through the lanthorn of our flesh so bright;</div>
      <div class='line'>What sacred splendour will this star send forth</div>
      <div class='line'>When it shall shine without this vail of Earth?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>She had to travel a darksome road, but he
brightened the way for her. He was so sure himself,
concerning the certainty of the truths he
uttered, that it seemed impossible for her to
doubt. A man himself who had never much
regarded the ways, nor manners, nor fashions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>of this present world, he was able to give her,
who had lived in the world all her life, many
hints as to where she was going astray, in what
errors she was indulging.</p>

<p class='c011'>He brought her the first snowdrop that put its
head above ground; he searched all the banks
and hedgerows for the “pale primrose;” he told
her when and where the birds were building, and
how many eggs there were in the blackbird’s nest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, she had her wish! She lived to touch
snowdrops and primroses; to hear the birds
singing, and see the trees putting forth; she
lived till nature put off her winter clothing,
and the sun shone over the earth once more;
then——</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gordon, I feel I shall soon have to go now,”
she said, one morning. “Thank you for staying
with me to the last.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She put her arms round his neck, and drew
his face down to hers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If all had gone well,” she whispered, “we
should now have been man and wife for sixteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>years. I wonder would that have made this
parting any easier?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Over and over and over again Major Morrice
kissed her, but it was a minute before he could
steady his voice sufficiently to answer—</p>

<p class='c011'>“You know I wanted you to be my wife even
at the end.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know it,” she sighed; “but Gordon, if you
marry, as I hope you may, you will not feel it so
hard to put another in the place I did not quite
fill, as——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, my love, my love! was it for my sake
you refused?” and the man’s tears fell upon her
like rain; “as if I could ever put another in your
place; as though my life were not over to all
intents and purposes now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want Phemie,” was the only answer she
made, and Phemie drew near. “You will be
friends when I am gone,” she went on, speaking
thickly and with difficulty. “You will not grow
to be quite strangers to one another as time goes
by. You will let Gordon talk about me to you,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>won’t you, dearest. And Gordon,” he stooped
his head, and Phemie drew back—“if ever you
think—in time—do not let any thought of me—remember
I wished——”</p>

<p class='c011'>Fortunate was it for Phemie that she had no
idea of what caused Major Morrice’s face to flush
so painfully in an instant—what made him look
aside as she arranged the pillows for her who
would so soon have done with earth—for her who
was passing swiftly to that land where no kindly
offices avail—where love, and tenderness, and
regret, and unselfishness are equally useless and
vain.</p>

<p class='c011'>All the day long they never left her; all the
day long she lay waiting for death to come, and
it was quite evening ere she went.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beside her were some flowers, fresh gathered
in the morning, withered and dying.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The flower fadeth,” she said, feebly, turning
towards Mr. Aggland; and, answering her
thoughts, he answered—</p>

<p class='c011'>“But the word of our God shall stand for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>ever.” A few minutes more and it was all
over.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Comfort him for me, Phemie,” were her last
words; and with her hand clasped in that of the
man she had loved so faithfully, she fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>She lived, as she had desired, till the flowers
sprang and the trees budded; and she left this
world certain about the next.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The last enemy that shall be destroyed is
death,” said Mr. Aggland, thoughtfully, as he
lingeringly left the room.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII.<br> <span class='c009'>OLD FRIENDS AND OLD PLACES.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Time went by, and still Phemie remained
unmarried.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suitors had come, and suitors had gone; but
to each and all the widow’s answer was the same.
She would never take a second husband. And
so time went on, and she was still, as I have said,
unmarried.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the years had in other respects worked
great changes in her. She was not the Phemie
we have seen in the pages that have been written.
She was outwardly a changed Phemie; a woman
who, finding that neither work nor solitude
availed to bring her peace, went in for distraction,
and was to be met with at every concert,
flower-show, pic-nic, what you will.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>It was Duncan Aggland who had greatly contributed
to bring about this alteration; Duncan,
who, seeming to imagine he owned a kind of
reversionary interest in his cousin, had wanted
her to cast her fortunes with his, and when she
declined to do so, remarked that she was staying
single for the sake of Basil Stondon—that he
knew she was, and that everybody said (oh! the
horror of that everybody) no young woman would
mew herself up at Roundwood as she did if she
had not been disappointed by some one; and
that further, he (the speaker) had not been so
blind as perhaps she imagined to the state of
affairs at Marshlands.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Duncan Aggland was very angry, or perhaps
he would never have uttered such very
disagreeable truths; and, like all people who are
angry, he got the worst of the encounter, for
Phemie thanked him for his engaging frankness,
and begged that for the future he would not
consider Roundwood so much his home as
formerly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>“Because,” she finished, “I purpose taking a
house in town, and I might see more of you then
than would be at all agreeable if you continued
to visit me as often as you have done.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I am doing so well, Phemie,” he pleaded,
becoming submissive in a moment. “I am to
be taken into partnership next year, and——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No one can be more delighted to hear of
your worldly advancement than I,” broke in
Phemie. “I am charmed to know you are doing
so well, and I have not the least doubt of your
ability to maintain a wife; but on principle I
object to the marriage of cousins, and whomsoever
I may choose hereafter to marry, be quite
sure it will not be you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is plain at any rate,” said the young
man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I meant it to be so,” she answered; “obscurity
can serve no good purpose on either side;
you have made a mistake, that is all, and it
would be unkind in me not to undeceive you.
Now, good-bye, and when you meet with any one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>you consider worthy to become Mrs. Duncan
Aggland, I, as the female head of your family,
shall be most happy to call upon her.” With
which speech, Mrs. Stondon dismissed her admirer,
and from that day forth devoted herself,
so far as any mere observer could discover, heart
and soul to amusement and frivolity.</p>

<p class='c011'>People who had seen the widow during her
time of mourning marvelled to behold her, when
that time was over, emerging from her seclusion,
accepting all invitations, appearing here and
there and everywhere, seeming to care very little
what was thought about her, providing only she
could pass the time and make the hours fly
quicker.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a flirt that woman is,” some one said,
casually, to Basil Stondon, when speaking of his
relative.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” thought Basil, as he walked home,
“what a flirt! Hang her, she never was anything
but a flirt. If she had, my life might have
been a different one.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>So, when men stumble over a pebble they are
apt to blame the pebble instead of their own
stupidity; so, when they fall into a hole they are
in the habit of anathematising the hole for being
there instead of their own blindness which was
unable to see it; and so on precisely the same
principle Basil accused Phemie of causing misfortunes
which had been brought about entirely
by himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>As for the life she led—the heartless, purposeless,
unsatisfying life—what can we say but this,
that there are some people who when they are
in trouble take to dram-drinking, while others
prefer opium; and in like manner there are men
and women who mentally seek the oblivion of
excitement, while others court the deadening
monotony of seclusion. Which is worst—providing
the patient must run to either extreme—to
one the wine cup, or to another the opium?
They are both so injurious, you answer, that it
would be impossible to make a choice, and yet
for Phemie I think the intoxication of society
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>was the least hurtful of the twain. To a temperament
like hers—secure against disappointment,
against love, against expectations that could
never be realised—excitement was surely less
fatal than inaction, the round of gaiety than the
round of endurance.</p>

<p class='c011'>The world was, as usual, critical and not over
kind in its remarks upon her: some people
saying she was seeking for a coronet, others that
a title would content her, even if the title were
no higher than that of baronet.</p>

<p class='c011'>As to her views and wishes, if she had any, all
her own relatives were at fault, even Mr. Aggland,
who only once ventured to say—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Be cautious, my dear, remember,</div>
      <div class='line'>That lovely face will fail;</div>
      <div class='line'>Beauty’s sweet—but beauty’s frail—</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis sooner past—’tis sooner done,</div>
      <div class='line'>Than summer’s rain or summer’s sun</div>
      <div class='line'>Most fleeting when it is most dear,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis gone while we but say ’tis here.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>To which Phemie answered by putting her
hand over his mouth, and saying—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, uncle, it went long ago; no need to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>remind me of how fast youth and beauty pass
away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They were rather unique, this uncle and niece,
and much sought after in London society accordingly.
Every grace of manner, every art and
conventionality Mrs. Stondon had acquired so
dearly, she put forth now to win her popularity
and regard.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her little affectations were brought out once
again—brought out and aired after years. She
fenced, she rallied, she retorted, she laughed, she
looked grave, according to the rules she had
taken so much trouble to learn.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, well, life is strange, and women are the
strangest part of life, and Phemie could not have
given a reason for what she did save this, that
she hoped some day to meet Basil Stondon and
his wife in society, and astonish them with her
cold bright wit, her unimpassioned manner, her
worldly ideas, and her unromantic views of life.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so the years went on, as I have said, and
still there was only one suitor who hung back,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>one man who felt that a woman like this was not
calculated to make his life happy, his home a
peaceful one.</p>

<p class='c011'>Obedient to the last request her lips had
framed, Major Morrice never through the years
lost sight of his dead love’s friend, but visited
her, talked with her, walked with her, and had
been so near proposing many times that the
world had almost ground for its gossip when it
said at last they were engaged.</p>

<p class='c011'>Never, however, even within sight of that shore
came they: the woman was serious—she really
did not intend to marry again. When her
friends fancied she was in jest, she spoke in
sober earnest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Had she been as one of those with whom she
was associating, she might have buried not one
but twenty husbands, and assisted at the obsequies
of the last with cheerful resignation. But
life with its sorrows, was an earnest affair to
Phemie, and its troubles were matters of serious
import to her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>“I suppose you think I like this whirl,” she
said, one day, to Major Morrice; and he answered,</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is impossible for me to think otherwise,
seeing how thoroughly you seem to enjoy it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“One must live,” Mrs. Stondon asserted, a
little defiantly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“True; but is it necessary always to live in
public?” he replied.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is to me,” she said; “it is to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would it be impertinent if I asked why?”
and he spoke with a tone of pity in his voice such
as Phemie had not heard previously in the voice
of any one unconnected with her by blood or
kinship.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because I have no home ties,” she returned;
“because I have neither father nor mother,
brother nor sister, husband nor children; because
I am lonely—lonely beyond all power of description.
There, you have made me talk about
myself; now forget me. Let us talk about something
else.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>“May I talk about myself?” he asked, drawing
a little nearer to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; that is always a welcome topic,” she
answered. And he went on—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I, too, am lonely in the world. Why should
we not cast our loneliness together. Will you
take me—knowing all the past—for your husband?
I will strive to prove myself worthy of
the trust——”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was astonished—too much astonished
perhaps at first to answer; but at last she slowly
said—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Major Morrice, you do not know what you
are saying; you do not know what you are
asking——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am praying you to be my wife,” he replied.
“Having loved your friend as far as man can
love, I am beseeching her friend to make me
happy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She laid her hand on his shoulder, and
looked steadily in his face while she answered—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>“Major Morrice, you may know how much the
past has taken from me when I say I cannot
accept a husband even like you. I think I may
truly affirm that I love and honour you more
than any man on earth; but I cannot marry you.
I would not give one like you the mere husk of a
love out of which the heart was eaten long and
long ago.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Very tenderly he talked to her, but it was of no
use. Very earnestly he pleaded that he had
affection enough and to spare for both. Phemie
was resolute.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are worthy a better fate,” she said. “I
have done harm enough in my life, let me be fair
and true and honest now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And she was all these, though it may have
been that for the moment she felt tempted to flee
from the awful loneliness of her purposeless existence—from
the cold selfishness of the world to
the warmth and the welcome of his love.</p>

<p class='c011'>But it was not to be—it was never to be. She
had toiled for her wages in the years which were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>gone, and her wages were now being paid to her
by no niggardly hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>That which we contract for we must fulfil—that
which we agree blindly, or with our eyes
open, to receive, we must content ourselves
withal.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The wages of sin is death.” She had sinned,
and death fell on every blade of grass near her—on
every shrub—on every flower.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the summer time, and a great longing
came over her to see the hills and the mountains
and the valleys and the wild dale country once
more.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should like to go to Cumberland for a
month,” she said, one day; and accordingly she
and her uncle and Helen set forth together on
that long northern journey which wearied Phemie
even before she reached the old “Salutation”
Inn, which has greeted so many a tourist entering
the Lake District.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, spite of her weariness, she could not rest
in the hotel. Tired and exhausted, Helen went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>off to bed, while Mr. Aggland and his niece
walked along the road which leads from Ambleside
to Rydal.</p>

<p class='c011'>They walked in silence; he was busy with his
thoughts, she with hers. They had come back
to the old country again, though not to the old
place. They had crossed the frontier and passed
out of the flat, rich southern lands into the lake
district, where mountains rose to the sky and
streams came down the hill sides; and the
traveller, wandering solitary over the fells, heard
the plash of distant waterfalls alone breaking the
desolate silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>They had come back from the bustle of great
towns, from intercourse with many men, from the
life which always grows more rapid and more
exciting the nearer people draw towards London—to
the old quiet home, to the tarns, to the
heather, to the mountains, to the valleys, which
were all the same as when Phemie had dwelt
among them, the adopted daughter of the owner
of the Hill Farm.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>She had left the wild mountain country when
the sun was shining brightly; in the noontide, in
the light; she returned to walk through it once
more, but the grey evening shadows were settling
down over the landscape, as the shadows had
settled upon her life. She left it to become a
great lady, and she had achieved that object.
She had gained wealth and position, and she was
now wondering, as she looked to right and left,
what wealth and position availed.</p>

<p class='c011'>They walked on, and the pure sweet air coming
down from among the hills seemed to put fresh
life into her, to restore something of the elasticity
of her youth. Side by side, still in silence, they
passed by Rydal Hill, through Rydal village, and
so on till they came within sight of a house which
most tourists in that part of England must have
paused to admire. It is a cottage set back a
little from the road, looking over Rydal Lake,
with Nab Scar and Helm Crag overshadowing it,
with the sweet greenery of that lovely country
swelling away from it on all sides, with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>summer flowers giving forth their sweetest perfume
around it, with climbers and creepers trailing
over it—a delightful spot in which to live, a
sad place in which to die.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are nooks on the earth that seem too
beautiful to leave; there are seasons when everything
in nature is so perfect, when her skies are
so soft, her woods so leafy, her sunsets so gorgeous,
her mornings so bright and gladsome, her
streams so clear, her lakes so calm, her flowers
and shrubs so fragrant, that it seems impossible
for man to go away from all this beauty and
brightness, to close his eyes on the face of this
lovely world, and never to open them in time again.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some thought of this kind came across
Phemie’s mind as she stood looking at the lake
and the landscape, which now lay bathed and
steeped in moonlight. For the first time for
years she felt that there was a happiness in the
mere fact of existence; that no human being can
have quite done with life so long as he remains
in the flesh. It came upon her suddenly that she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>had been wrong, that she had done wrong, in
suffering herself to grow so weary of so beautiful
a world; and as out of the fulness of the heart
the mouth speaketh, so out of her heart dropped
the sentence,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think one might grow almost happy again,
uncle, living in a place like this.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then they turned and retraced their steps,
talking as they went, talking under the moonlight
of many things about which they had held their
peace for years; and it was getting late when they
found themselves in Ambleside once more, and
entering the Salutation, at the door of which
hotel some excursionists were just alighting.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mother, and father, and children,” decided
Phemie, as she passed them by; and she would
have gone upstairs and thought no more of them
but for a voice which she fancied she knew,
exclaiming,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t run in so rudely, Harry; keep back,
sir.” Whereupon at once the lady said, “You
are always snubbing that boy, Basil.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>The person so addressed never turned to
answer; he caught the child, who was rushing
past Phemie, with one hand, while with the other
he raised his hat and apologised for his son’s
forwardness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You need not apologise to me,” answered
Phemie; “we are too old friends to stand on
ceremony.” And she put out her hand and
clasped his again after years—after years.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I declare,” cried Mrs. Basil Stondon,
while they all stood grouped together in the hall;
“if this is not a pleasant surprise. Who would
have thought of meeting you here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is nothing extraordinary in meeting
me,” Phemie answered; “the wonder is meeting
you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was a fancy of Basil’s,” that gentleman’s
wife replied. “He wanted to come north—and
so we came north; we have been here, in Westmoreland
I mean, ten days, and I for one was
getting terribly sick of it; but now you are in the
same place it will make a difference. It is so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>horrid being among strangers, not having a soul
one knows to speak to.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Phemie agreed that to be so placed must
indeed be distressing; and they all adjourned
upstairs, and having arranged to spend the evening
together, the ladies took off their bonnets
while the gentlemen ordered tea.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you positively look younger than when
I saw you last,” remarked Mrs. Basil Stondon,
querulously; “but it is easy for you to look
young: free from care and without children, and
surrounded by every blessing and comfort, why
should you not keep your beauty?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have not kept it,” answered Phemie, and
she sighed as she spoke; though the past with
its vanities, and its temptations, and its sorrows
and its repentance seemed like a dream to her at
the moment. “I have not kept it, and there is
no reason why I should have kept it. Youth
cannot stay with us for ever, Georgina; if it did,
girls would have small chance of ever being either
wooed or wed.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>There was a little side blow in this sentence,
and Georgina felt it. Her youth had helped her
to secure Basil, a prize she often told him was
scarcely worth the trouble, to which remark he
had a habit of retorting—</p>

<p class='c011'>“You did not think so at one time, at least,
judging by the trouble you took,” for Basil never
hesitated to remind his wife of the efforts she had
made to win him, and was not over delicate about
recapitulating to her all the advantages she had
gained for herself by the match.</p>

<p class='c011'>They lived such a life that the presence of any
stranger seemed a relief; and accordingly both
husband and wife eagerly pressed Mr. Aggland,
and Phemie, and Helen to join them in their
various excursions, and to make up parties for
visiting Keswick, and Coniston, and Ullswater,
and many a lovely spot much more accessible
from Ambleside than those just enumerated.</p>

<p class='c011'>Day after day they passed together, evening
after evening they spent, talking in the moonlight
or across the tea-table; but the more Phemie saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>of Basil and his wife, the more wretched she felt
satisfied they were.</p>

<p class='c011'>Georgina had not found the game all profit,
and was disappointed in some way. Basil did
not care for the woman he had married, and took
no pains to conceal that the only creature for
whom he now lived, and moved, and had his
being, was Harry, his son and heir, whom his
mother spoiled past redemption, and encouraged
in all acts of disobedience and rebellion, possibly
to annoy his father.</p>

<p class='c011'>As for the little girl, she went to the wall
entirely; neither father nor mother seemed to
recognise her as belonging to the same species as
Master Harry, who was for ever up to some mischief,
and being perpetually called to account for
his misdeeds by Basil, who “snubbed the child,”
so said his wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I do hope,” exclaimed Georgina, when
the day of separation came at last, “that you
will come and spend a long time with me in Norfolk.
It would be a real charity, for Basil is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>scarcely ever in the house. He leaves me alone
from morning till night. Now do come, will
you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you really wish me to come, Georgina?”
asked Mrs. Stondon, who had latterly begun to
doubt whether she heard and saw correctly. “Are
you speaking honestly and truly, when you say
you wish I would do so?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Honestly and truly, and there is my hand on
it,” laughed Georgina.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And your husband?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! my husband must answer for himself.
I never presume to understand what may be the
state of Basil’s mind on any subject. If you wish
him to invite you also, I will ask him to write you
a letter requesting the honour, et cetera; but I
should have thought my invitation sufficient. You
are such a great lady now, though, there is no
knowing how to deal with you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will come,” answered Phemie, suddenly,
“sometime in the autumn, when the trees are
looking their best.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>“That is a dear good creature,” remarked
Mrs. Basil Stondon, mentally adding, “now
that will drive Mrs. Montague away; and
if I once get her out of the house, I will
take precious good care she never enters it
again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>From which speech it will be perceived that
Georgina Stondon was not a particularly different
individual from Georgina Hurlford, but rather
that she was capable of planning and scheming a
little still.</p>

<p class='c011'>Late in the season Phemie returned to Roundwood;
but she had not been long settled there
before a letter arrived from Marshlands entreating
her not to forget her promise, but to come
as soon as ever she could, and bring her uncle
with her.</p>

<p class='c011'>His part of the performance Mr. Aggland emphatically
declined, and he could not quite resist
saying to his niece—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Phemie, do you think it is right for you to
go? Are you safe—are you strong—are you not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>mad, think you, to fling yourself into such peril
again?”</p>

<p class='c011'>They were standing in the drawing-room at
Roundwood as he spoke thus, he on one side of
the centre table, she on the other; and the light
of the wax candles fell full on her face as she
remained for a moment silent ere she answered—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am safe—I am strong—and I am not mad—and
I place myself in no peril. I am speaking
the truth,” she added, with a smile. “I have no
feeling now for Basil Stondon except that of
friendship and pity. Seeing him as he is—not
as I fancied him, but as he actually is—has done
more towards curing me than all my punishment—than
all my resolution.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And she put her hand in his, and he felt that
it did not tremble—that every finger lay passive—that
every nerve seemed still.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A woman’s mind is one of the inscrutable
mysteries of this earth to me,” decided Mr. Aggland,
as he thought over the puzzle of Phemie’s
conduct in his own apartment. “I reared that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>woman—I watched her in childhood, girlhood—and
best part of her womanhood I have spent
by her side—and yet I know no more about her
than if she were the greatest stranger upon earth.
Well, she seems resolved to put herself in danger,
but it is not my fault. Now, heaven and earth,”
finished the perplexed philosopher, “is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Down to Disley, Phemie travelled—over the
old familiar ground the train swept on; and she
took off her bonnet, and, drawing the blue
curtain so as to shade her eyes from the glare
of the light, looked out across the country just
as she had done that day when she returned to
Norfolk after her long sojourn abroad.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fields were the same—the stations—the
towns—the hedgerows—the poplars. Everything
seemed unchanged excepting herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a great hush in the still autumn
afternoon—a strange quietness in the air.
Phemie thought of that journey afterwards, and
remembered how often a calm precedes a storm.
She was travelling down into Norfolk, all unconsciously,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>to fulfil a mission; and as the train
sped on she tried to account to herself for the
desire she felt to revisit Marshlands and to
spend a few weeks with Basil and his wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was no love for Basil. She knew that.
She had examined her heart, and found the idol
in possession no longer. Her youth had gone,
and the passionate attachment of her youth with
it. And yet something remained—some tie of
memory, or association, or affection, or pity,
which was strong enough to bring the woman
back to Marshlands—to the dear home where
she had been so happy and so wretched.</p>

<p class='c011'>There came a point in that journey, however—at
Cambridge, I think—when Phemie, unable
fully to analyse her own sensations, turned
coward, and would fain have gone back again.</p>

<p class='c011'>She dreaded the sight of the old place, of the
familiar rooms, the resurrection of the thousand-and-one
recollections. She did not know whether,
after all, she could be quite brave when the pines
and the elms appeared standing clear against the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>sky as of yore. One by one the details of the
picture which had been blurred and destroyed a
little by the lapse of years came out clearly and
distinctly before her view.</p>

<p class='c011'>Only one thing she could not realise fully.
Basil master of Marshlands, Georgina mistress,
she herself their guest; children’s voices
echoing about the place, and those very children
leaving their games and their amusements, their
father and their mother, to come to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Was that the bait which lured the lonely
woman back to her old home? I do not know
how she could have blinded and deluded herself
into ignorance on this point when she knew that
the only gentle, womanly tears she had shed for
years fell over the face of Basil’s little girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had never desired children—she had
always held them away from her at arm’s length,
and yet now she would have liked to carry
“Fairy,” as she called her, back to Roundwood,
whether for love of the little creature, or for love
of its father, or simply because she wanted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>have something all to herself, who can say?
Only one fact is certain—the only pleasant hours
she passed in Marshlands were those when she
and Fairy wandered about the grounds hand-in-hand—when
the child came to her room and
listened to story and legend and song—when the
little feet came running to meet her, making
sweet pattering music by the way—when the soft
arms were stretched out to “Mamma Phemie,”
to “dear, dear Mamma Phemie,” who came at
last to the conclusion it was best for her to leave
Marshlands before Basil saw what an idiot she
had grown.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Basil saw it all—saw how his children
turned from his wife to the woman he still loved
better than his wife, and he grew angry at
Georgina for having asked Phemie to the house,
and words at last waxed hot between them on
the subject.</p>

<p class='c011'>For ever and for ever they were quarrelling, so
far as difference of opinion was concerned, and
wrangling over their differences. Phemie’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>presence or Phemie’s absence signified little,
only the quarrels became more vehement. Basil
accused Georgina of striving to hurt and annoy
him, Georgina declared that he had by his
temper driven away every old acquaintance they
possessed, and that she was determined to have
somebody to speak to.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If Mrs. Stondon were the devil,” she remarked,
with somewhat unladylike vehemence,
“I would cultivate her. I mean to go and stay
with her. I intend to be asked to her house in
town, and I do not intend to live any longer with
your mother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you mean to have your own way in everything,
then,” retorted Basil, “you had better put
in your list that you will have to live without
me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That would be no loss—a decided gain,” replied
Georgina. And thus the battle terminated
for the time, only to be resumed the next day
about Harry, who, young though he was, should,
his father declared, be sent to school forthwith,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>unless his mother would have him kept out of
the stable-yard, and away from the horse’s heels.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I tell you now what it is,” said Basil, collecting
all the men and women servants together,
and addressing them <i><span lang="fr">en masse</span></i>, “the first time I
find Master Harry in the stables, or out about
the grounds anywhere by himself, I will discharge
you every one. Take this for notice, for by ——
I will keep my word.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a milksop you would make of the boy,”
sneered Mrs. Basil Stondon. “What must the
servants think of you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They cannot think less of me than I do of
myself for ever having been such a cursed fool
as to marry you,” retorted Basil. Whereupon
one word led, as usual, to more, and the quarrel
terminated in Basil flinging a few things into a
portmanteau and starting for a friend’s house,
as was his wont whenever matrimony and the
cares thereof grew too much for him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fain would Phemie have followed his example
and taken flight also, but Georgina entreated her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>so earnestly to remain, that Mrs. Stondon yielded,
and wrote to her uncle not to expect her at
Roundwood for a week or ten days.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now I hope to heaven,” was Mr. Aggland’s
secret thought, “she is not getting too fond of
that place again, nor of its owner.” And his
hope was fulfilled.</p>

<p class='c011'>Phemie had grown perfectly sick of the place,
but she stayed on as a matter of kindness to
Georgina, and perhaps, also, with some faint
hope of opening the misguided woman’s eyes,
and making his home more comfortable for
Basil.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is of no use talking,” remarked Georgina,
one morning; “he ought to have married you,
that is the whole secret of the affair, and—and——”
She turned her head sharply away,
and Phemie heard her sob. She had packed the
cards, she had won all she asked for, and this
was the result—a wretched home, a neglectful
husband, a cat and dog existence. How could
Phemie help—spite of all the misery Georgina
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>had wrought her—feeling sorry for the unhappy
wife?</p>

<p class='c011'>“You might surely make a better thing of
your life still,” she said, gently, “if you would
only agree to bear and forbear; if you would
only bring up Harry as his father wishes; if you
would only just try for a little time, the effect of
meeting his views instead of thwarting them, I
am certain you might be a great deal more comfortable.
I am confident Basil would pay back
every concession with interest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He would not,” she answered, slowly. “You
may think you know Basil, but you do not. He
has never forgiven me, and he never will. He
might not have cared much for you had you been
married to him, but as you were not, he thinks
he only required you to make him the happiest
man on earth. I thought I could have made
him love me once,” she went on, speaking more
rapidly; “but I was mistaken. The way to
make a man like my husband hate you, is to
belong to him. I ought not to show you what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>an escape you had,” she added; “but I owe you
a good turn for the bad one I did you when I
was a girl; and for all the rest, I have forgiven
you long ago, I have indeed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are very kind,” answered Phemie; “but
I have not the slightest idea what you had to
forgive.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you not? I may tell you some day,
but not at present.” And Georgina walked, as
she spoke, to the window, opened it, and stepped
out on the balcony mentioned in the earlier
portion of this story.</p>

<p class='c011'>She remained leaning over it for a few
minutes, turning every now and then to address
some sentence to Phemie, who stood behind her
in the drawing-room. She talked much about
Miss Derno, and how greatly she had disliked
her, how firmly she had believed in her designs
on Basil.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I really thought at the time,” she was proceeding,
when she suddenly stopped.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What—what is it?” she broke out. “What
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>are they bringing? Mrs. Stondon—quick—look,
do you see that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Phemie ran, at the words, into the balcony,
and then as instantly left it, and rushed from the
drawing-room, and out at the front door, and
round the house, and through the shrubberies,
to a point where she met the men who had
attracted Georgina’s attention.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the matter?” she asked, with a quick
look behind to see if Georgina were following.
“What is it?” And the group parted in silence
and let her look for herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Involuntarily she cried out, and the cry was
repeated at her elbow by the wretched mother,
who shrieked—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I knew it was Harry. Bring him in and
send for the doctor. Ride for your lives. Why
do you all stand there doing nothing?” she
went on fiercely, for the men never moved, but
looked either down to the ground, or else each in
his fellow’s face. “Do you hear me? Go for
the doctor. Give me my son.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>“Give him to me,” Phemie said, and they put
the child into her arms. His little hand dropped
limp as they did so, and his head fell back.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ride for the doctor,” Phemie ordered, “for
your mistress.” And she led the way into the
house, carrying the dead heir of all those broad
lands, of all that fine property, while the men
lifted Georgina from the ground, where she had
dropped, not absolutely fainting, but down in an
incapable heap, and bore her in after the boy,
for whose sake she had once forgotten her pain
and her travail, and rejoiced that there was a
man-child born into the world!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII.<br> <span class='c009'>PHEMIE’S JOURNEY.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>For hours Mrs. Basil Stondon lay in that
merciful stupor.</p>

<p class='c011'>While tender and pitying hands dressed the
child for his long sleep, dressed him all in white
and left him on his little bed—while the servants
went about the darkened house with quiet tread,
and asked one another under their breath what
their master would say, and whether they should
all be dismissed, and if an inquest would have
to be held—while the few remaining leaves on
the elm trees fell one by one off the bare
branches—while the late autumn day drew to its
close—Georgina still lay without speaking a
word, without moving hand or foot.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>By her side Phemie sat thinking, not so much
of the miserable mother or of the dead boy, but
rather of what Basil would say—of how Basil
would feel.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once she went halfway down stairs intending
to send a messenger for him; but long before
she reached the bottom of the flight she changed
her mind and ascended the broad stairs again.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two or three times she took up a pen and
drew paper and portfolio before her, thinking to
write and break the news.</p>

<p class='c011'>She began—“My dear Mr. Stondon,” and tore
that up; then she commenced, “Dear Basil,”
and tried to go on and tell him of the disaster
that had happened.</p>

<p class='c011'>But it would not do. When a person thinks,
words flow like water; when he writes, they
freeze on the paper; and Phemie tore up that
epistle likewise.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then she went and looked at the child—at the
glory of golden hair—at the round smooth cheeks—at
the body which had been so full of life and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>health but a few hours before. He had been a
troublesome imp when living—a restless, noisy,
daring, unmanageable boy; but he was quiet
enough now. He had been wont to push “Fairy”
away from Phemie’s side, and to strike Phemie
when she took his sister up in her arms and
comforted her. There was not a dress in Mrs.
Stondon’s wardrobe but bore testimony to the
strength of Master Harry’s hands, but the child
was quiet enough now; and when Phemie looked
upon all that remained of Basil’s son—when she
felt what he would feel when he came to look
upon his dead also, she fell on her knees beside
the boy, and her heart seemed to cry in spite of
her own desire—“How will he bear it! how will
he ever endure this sight!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Any one entering that room would have imagined
Phemie to be praying, as kneeling on the
floor she remained with her arms stretched over
the snowy sheet, and her head resting upon
them; but in reality Phemie was not praying—she
was thinking—going over the weary past—traversing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>the old roads over again—wondering
when the end would come, and what the end
would be.</p>

<p class='c011'>As she had suffered, was he to suffer? As she
had wept, was he to weep? Had the hour for
settlement come at last, and was this part of his
temporal wages?</p>

<p class='c011'>Sin! He had sinned, and while Phemie knelt
there in the gathering darkness she recited to
herself that story out of The Book which
begins,—</p>

<p class='c011'>“There were two men in one city, the one
rich and the other poor. The rich man had
exceeding many flocks and herds, but the poor
man had nothing save one little ewe lamb, which
he had bought and nourished up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She never knew why that pathetic tale—so
terribly pathetic that the sinner’s sin is almost
forgotten in the sinner’s misery and humility—should
come back to her memory then.</p>

<p class='c011'>Was it for the sins of the father that the child
which had been born unto Basil, and become to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>him as the very apple of his eye, was taken away
thus—the fruit of his body for the sin of his
soul.</p>

<p class='c011'>Was it? Phemie had enough of the old
Covenanting spirit in her religion to say, in
answer to her own question, “Lord, it is just;”
and yet her softer, weaker, human nature trembled
to think of that inexorable justice which
seemed never to forget to remember sin—which
seemed never weary of awarding punishment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“O God, let me bear—let me;” and Phemie
prayed at last. All the dross had been taken
out of her nature, and I think she was pure and
unselfish at that moment as the angels in heaven.
“Punish him no further—but let me bear all;”
and then she bethought her of the words of
Solomon the son of David.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If they sin against Thee (for there is no
man that sinneth not), and Thou be angry with
them, and deliver them to the enemy; yet if
they bethink themselves and repent, and make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>supplication, saying,—We have done perversely;
we have committed wickedness: Then hear
Thou in Heaven, and forgive the sin of Thy
people.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hear, O Lord,” Phemie added, and her tears
fell hot and fast. “Hear and pity, and enable
him to bear this trouble Thou hast laid upon
him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who will tell Basil?” she marvelled, as she
rose from the ground—“who?” And she wished
her uncle were with her, feeling that he perhaps
might have been the best bearer of bad tidings
possible to find under the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can telegraph for him at any rate,” she
considered, and the idea gave her immediate
relief.</p>

<p class='c011'>He would advise and assist. There were a
dozen things he could see to, and his presence
would be a restraint—a man’s presence always
was.</p>

<p class='c011'>Phemie decided to send for him, and half-an-hour
afterwards one of the Marshland servants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>was galloping to Disley in order to despatch her
telegram.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had not been gone ten minutes, however,
before Georgina spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it true?” she said, faintly; and Phemie
answered, “It is true.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is dead, then?” and Mrs. Stondon
replied, “Everything that could be done was
done; but he never moved after the horse kicked
him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There ensued a silence; then the wife uttered
her husband’s name.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shall I write to him?” asked Phemie. “I
have not done so till I heard what your wishes
were.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You must go to him,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go—I—” repeated Phemie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, he will never come back if you do not—never;
and you owe it to me,” went on the
wretched woman, “to do what I ask. I told you
this morning I had forgiven you long ago, but it
was not the truth. I thought it was then; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>I must have been mistaken. If you go, and
bring him back, and keep him from cursing me,
I will forgive you—I will kiss the ground you
walk on—I will love you as I have hated you.
Go!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What shall I say to him?” asked Mrs.
Stondon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What you like. You used to be able to wind
him round your finger, try your power now. Go,
go, for God’s sake, before he hears about it from
any other person—go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Phemie rose and stood irresolute, then—“It is
not fitting I should do this thing,” she said. “I
will write to him if you like, or I will telegraph to
my uncle to go to him direct, but you ask too
much of me, Georgina, you do indeed. Basil is
certain to return to see his child, and then you
can tell him about—about—the accident. I
cannot interfere between man and wife.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Cannot you?—give me the medicine, or wine,
or water, or something; and let me speak out my
mind. Have you never interfered between us?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>she went on, after swallowing the wine Phemie
poured out for her. “Have I not felt you stepping
between us every hour since my marriage.
Did you not lay it on him as a curse—that he
should never love any one as he loved you. Did
not you, and has not the curse stuck? Has he
ever loved another since—has he ever loved me?”
and the unloved wife broke out into a fit of such
passionate weeping as took Phemie totally by
surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear Georgina,” she began soothingly, but
the other interrupted her with—“You need not
try to smooth the matter over; if it had not been
for you he might have loved me (I have been
lying thinking over it all while you were out of
the room), but as it was, he never loved me, and
he will hate me now. He will say I did it, and
perhaps he will say true. Whatever he wished
Harry not to do I encouraged Harry to do, and
now—and now—he will never speak to me again;
he never will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He will not be so cruel, so unmanly,” Phemie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>said; but Georgina answered, “Ah! you do not
know Basil Stondon, he can be both when he
likes,” and she buried her face in the pillows, and
sobbed aloud.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will go to him,” Phemie murmured; her
soul travelled back at that instant over the years,
to the days when Basil had been cruel and unmanly
towards her, and she accepted the errand
which was now put upon her, as she would any
other that had arisen out of the mad foolishness
of that wretchedly happy time. “If I were to
telegraph though to him to return, as Harry was
ill, and then break it to him on his return, would
it not do as well as my going?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The people at the station would tell him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But if I met him at the station.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He would hear about it on the line.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was thus Georgina answered every argument,
and at length, worn out by her importunity,
Phemie yielded, and was about leaving the room
to make the needful arrangements for her departure,
when she was stopped once more.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>“Whom were you thinking of taking with you,”
asked Georgina.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Either Harris or Marshall,” was the reply.
“Harris, if you could spare him, would be the
best.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take neither,” was the reply; “Basil would
get the truth from them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And do you absolutely wish me to travel to
a strange place by myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes—to serve me—to do me such a kindness,”
and she took Phemie’s hand and kissed it
humbly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Within an hour Mrs. Stondon drove out of the
gates of Marshlands, and started, all alone, to find
Basil. Less than most women of the present day
had she ever been thrown on her own resources,
and the journey which no woman would have
regarded as a pleasant one, seemed formidable in
the extreme to her. All night she travelled on
main lines or cross lines; now the compartment
she occupied was shunted on one side at a junction,
again she had to get out at some hitherto
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>unheard of station and change carriages, in order
to reach her destination, which was a little out-of-the-way
village in Yorkshire, where she arrived
cold and stiff and weary, next morning at nine
o’clock.</p>

<p class='c011'>Quarry Moor boasted neither hotel nor station,
nor town nor village. Passengers who desired to
alight there, communicated their wishes to the
guard at the previous stopping place; and accordingly,
Phemie found herself dropped at a gate,
without a house in sight, or a living being to
speak to, except the man who made signals
that passengers were to be taken up, and who
resided during business hours in a wooden box
beside the line.</p>

<p class='c011'>With some difficulty Phemie made this individual
understand her position, and after a little
hesitation, he gave her what probably might be
regarded as sound advice.</p>

<p class='c011'>In a wonderful accent he said, “she had better
go straight on till she came to Mr. Urkirs’ farm,
and if you tell him what you want, happen he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>will spare one of his labourers to take your message
over to Goresby Manor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Very patiently Phemie plodded on, with the
moor stretching to right and left, the straight
unfenced road before her, and the cold grey sky
above. It did not seem to her that it was really
she, Phemie Stondon, who was walking all by
herself through Yorkshire; who had been travelling
by night till she was frozen and stupefied; the
whole performance appeared so like part of a
dream, that she had to stop occasionally to realise
she was hundreds of miles from her own home,
and half way across Quarry Moor, on her way to
tell Basil of his son’s death.</p>

<p class='c011'>On her arrival at the farm, Phemie found Mr.
Urkirs out, but Mrs. Urkirs received the stranger
very graciously, and at once promised to send one
of the men over to Goresby.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Goresby is our landlord,” she explained,
“and very likely the gentleman you want is one
I saw riding past here with him yesterday. If
you would like to go on, William shall put the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>horse in the chaise and drive you over—but perhaps
you would not——”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Urkirs stopped; the thought in her mind
was—perhaps the lady might not care to drive in
a chaise with William for charioteer, but there
was a look in Phemie’s face that told the worthy
woman she would have gone in a wheelbarrow
had any necessity existed for her doing
so.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I need not go on,” Phemie answered, however.
“If you would allow me to remain here, I
should much prefer doing so. Can you let me
write a note to Mr. Stondon. He may not
understand a verbal message.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Considering the present price of paper, considering
the millions of steel pens that are manufactured,
and the rivers of ink which flow annually
out of London, it is wonderful to consider that
there are hundreds of thousands of houses in the
United Kingdom where a letter never seems to be
written, where ink might be made of attar of
roses, and pens sold at a guinea a piece, judging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>from the specimens of each which are presented
for a visitor’s benefit.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even in the midst of her sorrow and anxiety,
Phemie could not help some idea of this sort
passing through her mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Urkirs brought her first a quarter of a
sheet of letter paper, then a bit of blotting paper
about an inch and a-half square, then one of
those penny stone ink bottles which were invented
for the confusion of mankind, together
with an old steel pen—which she rubbed “soft,”
as she said, on the hearthstone—and a quill
that had apparently been in use for a couple or
so of generations.</p>

<p class='c011'>Out of these materials Phemie constructed her
epistle. It seemed easier to write in the lonely
farm-house than it had done at Marshlands—besides,
she had no time to lose, no paper to
waste; as the words were set down so they had to
stand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear Basil,” she began, and she wrote
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>closely that she might not run short of space.
“Dear Basil, I have come all this way at
Georgina’s request to say Harry is very ill, and
to beg you to return home with me at once. I
entreat of you not to let anything prevent your
coming. Mrs. Urkirs kindly allows me to
remain here till the messenger returns. I have
directed him, if you are not at the Manor, to
follow and give this to you.</p>

<div class='c014'>“<span class='sc'>Phemie Stondon.</span>”</div>

<p class='c011'>It was the first letter she had ever written to
Basil, and while she folded it up she thought
about that fact.</p>

<p class='c011'>After William had mounted and departed she
still went on thinking, and sate by the fire considering
how strange it was she never should
have written to him before—that no necessity
had arisen through all the years of their acquaintance
for her to send him even the merest
line. How wonderful it was that on her should
devolve the duty of making the man she loved
wretched!</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>“I do not know how I shall ever tell him,”
she thought. “I do not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And the child is very ill, ma’am, you say,”
remarked Mrs. Urkirs at this juncture.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is dangerously ill,” answered Phemie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And what a journey it was for you,” went
on the farmer’s wife, who—the excitement of
looking up writing materials and of despatching
William over—was beginning to think the
business odd.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A fearful journey,” was the reply, and Mrs.
Stondon shivered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Could no person have come but you, ma’am,”
was the next question.</p>

<p class='c011'>“His mother thought not,” answered Phemie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are the gentleman’s sister, I suppose,”
suggested Mrs. Urkirs, after a pause, devoted
to considering how she could possibly get at the
bottom of the mystery.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” Phemie said; “I am only a very
distant relative of Mr. Stondon,” and she rose as
she spoke and leaned her head against the stone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>mantelshelf, and thought how she could best
stop the woman’s questions.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mrs. Stondon had a very special reason for
wishing me to carry the message instead of
entrusting it to a servant,” she began at last.
“I will tell you what that reason was before I
go, but I cannot do so until after I have spoken
to Mr. Stondon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>From that moment the two got on admirably.
They talked about farming, about Yorkshire,
about children, about London, about Norfolk,
about Marshlands, about every conceivable topic,
including the health of Mr. Urkirs and his
“one fault,” as his wife styled it, namely a disinclination
to leave a “drain of spirits in a bottle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Phemie had gone in a little for model farming
at Roundwood, and was able to discourse gravely
concerning stock and milch cows, soils and
rotations.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lessons she had learned among the hills
were applied practically to the lands in Sussex,
and Mrs. Urkirs told her husband subsequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>that, to be a lady, Mrs. Stondon knew more about
cropping than any woman she had ever met with.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Stondon, on her part, was thinking all
the time they conversed, of Basil’s child and the
Hill Farm. Could she really ever have lived
in a farm-house? Was it true that Basil’s boy
was dead? In a vague kind of way she began to
wonder whether, when he and she returned to
Marshlands, they might not find it was all a
mistake—that the doctor had done something—that
Harry would yet be restored. Mercifully,
death, when we are away from it, is hard to
realise; till the first force of the blow is almost
expended we never seem quite to lose hope; and
thus it was that Phemie had to rouse herself
occasionally in order to remember that the life
was gone past recovery—that Basil could never
hear Harry’s voice again—that it was to his
dead not to his sick she had come to summon
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder how soon your man can return,”
she said at last.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>“Well, ma’am, it depends on whether he
would have only to go to Goresby or further. If
Mr. Stondon was at the Manor he might—— But
here is the gentleman himself,” she added, as
Basil came galloping along the road and up to
the farm, where, flinging his bridle to one of the
labourers, he threw himself from his horse and
came hurriedly into the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the matter with Harry?” were the
first words he spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He has met with an accident,” answered
Phemie, while Mrs. Urkirs discreetly withdrew.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How—when—where?” he persisted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yesterday; somehow in the stable-yard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He muttered an oath, and took a turn up and
down the farm kitchen before he broke out—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Weren’t there enough of you about the house
to have kept him out of harm’s way. Sometimes
I cannot think what women were sent into the
world for at all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not answer him. She knew what he
did not know, and it kept her tongue quiet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>otherwise Phemie was not the one to have
endured such a speech quietly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her silence had its effect, however, for he said
next moment—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I beg your pardon; of course I was not
thinking of you, but of my wife.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say what you like to me,” Phemie replied,
“but spare your wife. She has suffered enough;
she is very seriously ill.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In answer to which appeal Basil said something
under his breath, to the effect that she
could sham illness when it suited her purpose,
and impose on doctors as she had once imposed
on him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is not shamming now, at any rate,”
Phemie answered, and Basil continued his
walk.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is he badly hurt?” he began again, after a
pause.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am afraid so.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is he in danger?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>“Was he insensible?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; he had not spoken when I left.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And why did you leave him? Why could
you not have sent one of the servants?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because I know everything that could be
done for him would be done, and I wished you
to return to Marshlands immediately. I wanted
to telegraph, but Georgina would not hear of it;
so I started to find you as soon as possible.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have travelled all night then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; I arrived here at nine o’clock this
morning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You must be very tired,” and he came up to
where she stood and looked in her face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If travelling for a year could do you or yours
any good, Basil, I should not mind being tired!”
she exclaimed, and her eyes filled with tears, to
remember nothing she could do might be of any
use now, to him or his.</p>

<p class='c011'>He remained silent for an instant; but then,
putting out his hand, he touched hers, and said,
piteously—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>“What a fool I was, Phemie!—oh, what a
fool!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do not be one now then, Basil,” she
answered, and she drew her hand away from his
and stepped back a pace or two.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When does the train start?” she asked, and
the question brought Basil to his senses.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We have not much time to spare,” he said;
“there is a train at one o’clock. If we catch that
we can then get a special once we reach the
main line. But how are you to get over to the
station? How did you come here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I walked,” she answered, “but Mrs. Urkirs
will allow one of her men to drive me back, I
know.” And so it was settled that they should
start immediately, and while Basil went out to
speak about putting in the horse, Phemie talked
to Mrs. Urkirs, and with that individual’s assistance
equipped herself for the journey.</p>

<p class='c011'>When everything had been prepared for their
departure; when Mrs. Stondon, duly wrapped up,
was seated in Mr. Urkirs’ light cart; when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>Basil was mounted, and the boy whom he meant
to take charge of his horse to Goresby had nestled
down into the body of the vehicle, behind Phemie
and the driver, the former stooped over the
wheel and whispered to Mrs. Urkirs—who had
come out to see that the rug was so disposed as
to keep her visitor’s dress from being splashed—stooped
and whispered—</p>

<p class='c011'>“The child is dead, and I want to break it to
him gently as we go home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would rather she had the breaking of it to
him than I,” remarked Mr. Goresby when Mrs.
Urkirs, an hour subsequently, communicated to
that gentleman the piece of information she had
gained.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Goresby was a fresh, hearty, middle-aged
squire, of the men-who-have-no-nonsense-about-them
stamp, and he did feel most grievously
sorry to hear of the misfortune that had fallen
on his friend.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was this Mrs. Stondon a young woman?”
he asked—standing beside the door of the farm-house,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>with his arm through his horse’s bridle,
and his foot keeping turning—turning a loose
stone as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Over thirty, I should think, sir,” was the
reply. “Tall and stately-looking, and proud,
seemingly, till you came to speak to her, but
then she was just as pleasant and homely as
yourself. She sat there in that corner by the
fire, and cried when she talked about the child
as she might if it had been one of her own.
It was wonderful of her coming all this way
by herself; there are few ladies, I am thinking,
would have done it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are right there, Mrs. Urkirs,” answered
the squire, and he mounted his hack and rode
leisurely home to Goresby Manor, wishing to
himself he had seen Phemie, and marvelling
whether she was the former love he had once heard
the mistress of Marshlands twitting her husband
concerning.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I suppose there is a woman at the bottom of
every misfortune that happens to a man, if we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>could only search deep enough,” decided Mr.
Goresby, who, being a bachelor, had always felt
an intense curiosity to know the ins and outs
of whatever love affair it was in Basil Stondon’s
past which had, as he mentally rounded the
sentence, “put his life all wrong.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.<br> <span class='c009'>THE RETURN.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>While Mr. Goresby was trotting back to the
Manor, over the Yorkshire moors, Phemie and
her companion were travelling southward as fast
as a train which stopped at every station and
kept time at none, could take them.</p>

<p class='c011'>They had the compartment to themselves, and
each five minutes Phemie looked at her watch,
and said to herself, “Now in a quarter of an hour
I shall have told him,” but when the quarter
came and passed, Basil still thought his child
was living.</p>

<p class='c011'>He talked continuously about Harry and about
his wife; he let the whole history of their wretched
experience drop from his lips, sentence after sentence.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>He said it was Marshlands she had
wanted, and Marshlands she had got; he declared
she thwarted him in his every wish—that it was
enough for him to express a desire, and straightway
she opposed him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As for her children, she never cared for them—not
in the least,” he went on; “she never cared
for me either. Give her money and dress, and
equipage and servants, and she would not fret if
she never saw me more. She shall have her wish
now; she may live in London or any place she
likes, so as she leaves me and the children in
peace at Marshlands. The children!” he broke
off suddenly. “Oh! Phemie, do you think Harry
will recover?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am afraid there is no hope,” she answered,
trying to steady her voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She must not let me see her if anything happens
to him,” he said, doggedly, and he went on
to ask his companion whether she thought they
would be in time, and then he broke into a rage
about the slowness of the trains, about the folly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>of not telegraphing for him instead of coming,
about the certainty that whatever Georgina planned
was sure to be wrong, about his conviction that
if Phemie had stayed at Marshlands more might
have been done for the boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who would sit up with him last night?” he
went on; “who would attend to everything that
the doctor directed? The idea of leaving the place
with only servants under the circumstances, and
Georgina even not being able to see to things! I
think she is mad, I really do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I sent for my uncle,” remarked Phemie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is what she never would have thought
of,” was the husband’s comment. Phemie drew
back in her corner, feeling she could not tell him
the worst, that he was impracticable, that he was
selfish beyond anything she could have conceived
of, that his affection for his child was but another
form of affection for himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>What good had her coming wrought, then? Had
it done any one of the things Georgina had prayed
of her to effect? They would speak indeed, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>there would be a quarrel—possibly a separation,
for that was evidently the result Basil desired to
bring about.</p>

<p class='c011'>Never before, never had Phemie felt herself so
powerless as with this man, who once professed to
love her; and it was for him—oh! Heaven, it was
for one like this—she had broken her husband’s
heart, and nearly brought dishonour on an honest
man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How I loved him—God of mercy, <em>how</em> I
loved him,” she murmured to herself, while her
companion still kept rhyming out his complaints,
and then, thinking of all the misery of the past—of
the terrible trial in store for him—of the fearful
contrast between his thoughts and hers, her self-command
gave way, and covering her face with
her hands, sobbed like a child.</p>

<p class='c011'>In an instant Basil ceased his lamentations; the
very tone of his voice changed as he asked her
what was the matter—what he had said to vex her—why
she was weeping. He drew her hands from
before her eyes with a gentle force, and prayed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>her to stop crying, or, at all events, to tell him
what she was crying for.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was thinking about the years gone by,” she
answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Those happy years,” he said, and the voice
was tender as the voice she remembered so well.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Were they happy to you?” she returned.
“They were not so to me. Can you bear to look
back upon them?—I cannot,” and then, urged by
necessity, Phemie made a speech which brought
the colour to her cheeks and dried the tears in her
eyes. “You said you loved me in those days,
Basil—was it true?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“True as sorrow,” he answered; but he felt
there was something behind her question, and he
kept his hand on her arm, and prevented her
turning completely away from him, while she proceeded—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not want to go back and tell of all
the misery you caused me then, but I do want
you to promise me something now, for the sake of
that old dead love of the long ago.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>“Not dead, Phemie!—not dead!” he replied.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do not say that, or you stop me,” she returned;
“or say it if you can, remembering everything,
and I will frame my request differently. For the
sake of the man who forgave you and me, both of
us, will you promise to grant me one favour?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want you not to speak harshly to your wife.
I want you not to reproach her. I want you never
by word or look to lay this—this accident at her
door, whether Harry lives or whether he dies.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He remained for a few moments looking down
at the carpet on the floor of the carriage, then he
answered—“You do not know everything, and
your request is harder to grant than perhaps you
can imagine, but still I will keep my promise—I
will not reproach her;” and he got up from his
seat and went to the opposite window to that at
Phemie’s left hand, and looked out over the
country, and stamped his foot for very impatience
at the slow rate of travelling, and wondered if
they ever should arrive at the junction, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>how long it would take to get a special train
ready.</p>

<p class='c011'>She let him run on for a time in this manner,
while she searched about for some form of words
in which she might convey an idea of the worst
to him. Over and over again he said—“nothing
ever really hurt children; that they were like cats
and had nine lives;” he wondered if Mr. Aggland
would think of having a surgeon down from
London; he mourned about his own absence
from home, and then he began abusing the railway
arrangements once more, and finally, pulling
out his watch for the hundredth time, declared
they ought to be at the junction in ten minutes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Once there, instead of waiting for the express
we must get a special, and push on at a very
different pace to this.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He flung himself into the seat by the window,
as he spoke, and Phemie having at last made up
her mind that she would tell him, left her place,
and took the one opposite to that he occupied.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had been thinking over the words she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>should use for hours, and yet now no word she
had intended to employ was uttered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Basil.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Phemie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We need not hurry so much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you mean?”—he asked the question
as though there was no necessity for him to
do so.</p>

<p class='c011'>He read the answer in her face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! Basil—Basil!” she cried; and after
that there was a great silence, while the train
swept on.</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not dare to look at him—but she felt
blindly about for his hand, and took and held it
in hers;—and he let it lie there passive.</p>

<p class='c011'>When they came near to the junction, she
resumed her old position, from which she stole a
glance at Basil.</p>

<p class='c011'>His face was shaded by his hand, and she
could tell nothing of how it was with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a great shriek and hustle, the train rushed
into the station.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>“He was dead, then, when you left,” Basil
said, without lifting his head, or turning his face,
or moving his hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” she answered; and the train stopped,
and the junction he had desired so earnestly to
reach was gained.</p>

<p class='c011'>Through the darkness, Phemie and Basil travelled
on together, not by any special train
but by the express, in which once again they were
able to have a compartment to themselves. By
the time they left the junction, the short day
was drawing to its close; and before they had
got twenty miles nearer home it was quite dark,
and the stations through which they shot were
lighted up and bright with gas.</p>

<p class='c011'>They never spoke to one another. Greatly
that journey reminded Phemie of a former one
she had undertaken, when, through the night,
she and her uncle hastened away from Marshlands
to seek a new home. Then it had been
Mr. Aggland who sate beside the window looking
out into the summer night; now it was Basil who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>never turned his head away from the contemplation
of the blackness, which was no darker than
his own thoughts.</p>

<p class='c011'>Through the night the train dashed on—through
the hours he and she never opened
their lips to speak to one another.</p>

<p class='c011'>She would have given anything to hear his
voice—to hear even the sound of lamentation
and the words of mourning, but Basil remained
obstinately mute.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was thinking of his boy—his first-born—the
child whom he brought from India with
him—thinking of him, and of his wife, and of
the woman who had carried the evil tidings to
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>For the first time, also, he was thinking
of his life—of his past—of the sin that past
held.</p>

<p class='c011'>Every idea seemed vague and shadowy—the
only one certainty he appeared able to grasp being
that Harry was dead, and that he was travelling
home to see him.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Home—what a mockery the word sounded!</p>

<p class='c011'>At Disley they found Mr. Aggland waiting for
their arrival on the platform.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I brought the carriage over on chance,” he
said, “hoping you might return by this train.
Mrs. Stondon is very ill,” he added, addressing
Basil. But Basil paid no attention to the sentence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Does he know?” whispered Mr. Aggland to
his niece, who nodded an affirmative.</p>

<p class='c011'>After they reached Marshlands, Basil stood
in the hall for a moment, like a man trying to
collect his senses; but when Phemie was going
to leave him with her uncle, he detained her,
saying—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want to see——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Had you not better wait a little?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>He only answered her with an impatient gesture,
and motioned that she should lead the
way.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>She ascended the staircase, he following;
they passed by the door of Mrs. Stondon’s room,
and at the end of a long corridor crossed
the threshold of the chamber in which the
child lay.</p>

<p class='c011'>Almost involuntarily as it seemed, Basil caught
hold of Phemie’s hand, after the fashion of a
frightened girl; and so, together, side by side,
they walked towards the bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>He let her draw back the sheet, and then,
trembling violently, looked upon his boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Till that moment it seemed as if he had not
fully realised his loss. But whenever his eyes
fell on the face—which was the face of his first-born
and yet that of a stranger,—when he
touched the little cold hands, and pressed his
lips on the icy cheeks, Basil Stondon gave way,
and his grief burst out wild and uncontrolled.</p>

<p class='c011'>Phemie moved back and closed the door.
Then, standing at a distance from him, she let
the trouble flow on unchecked,—only, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>folded hands and bowed head, prayed for him
silently.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are few things in life harder to look
upon than a man’s violent sorrow;—and Phemie
found it hard to witness Basil’s. But yet she
never tried to comfort him; she never crossed
the room and laid her hand on his shoulder, and
spoke to him words of sympathy. She knew the
passion must find vent;—she felt that such an
outburst was better for him than his former
silence; and so she let the grief take its course
without check or comment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell me about it,” he said at last; “tell me
all you know.” And, thus entreated, Phemie
told him how the child had given his nurse the
slip, and got round to the stables during the
men’s dinner hour.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sewell saw him, but not in time,” she went
on. “He saw Harry striking the young grey
horse with a leather strap across the hind legs—so”—and
Phemie imitated the boy’s heedless
stroke. “Sewell shouted to him to come away,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>and ran across the yard to catch him, but before
he could reach the stall the animal kicked out,
and Harry never stirred again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have punished him for that very trick a
dozen times at least,” said Basil; “and his
mother has called me cruel for hindering him.
What have they done with the horse?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not know,” answered Phemie.</p>

<p class='c011'>He went away along the corridor, and down
the staircase, and so into the servants’ hall;
where, finding Sewell, he desired him to have the
grey killed at once.</p>

<p class='c011'>After that he returned to Harry’s room; and
neither persuasion nor remonstrance could induce
him to move from it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you remember your promise, Basil?”
Phemie asked at last, seeing that he made no
movement to go and speak to his wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perfectly,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And do you mean to keep it?” she persisted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am keeping it,” he said; “and shall keep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>it all the better if I stay away from her. I cannot
go and see her; I cannot. If you will have
it, I shall say something you would be sorry for.
Do not ask me. Phemie—Phemie—for heaven’s
sake, leave me alone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But she would not leave him alone. She
prayed and entreated of him to go and see his
wife. She persisted that unless he did so, he
would be but quibbling with his word—breaking
faith with her. She reminded him that it was
Georgina’s child as well as his who lay before
him; and at last, finding her words had none
effect, she left the room, and tried to soothe his
wife with such excuses for his absence as she
could invent.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a time, however, a message came from
Basil, desiring to speak with her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will go and tell her I shall never reproach
her, if you wish me to do so,” he said. “You
have been very good to me, Phemie—very good,
and kind, and patient; and you have gone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>through much for my sake, and I will pleasure
you in this matter if you like.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“God bless you, Basil,” answered Phemie—“God
bless and comfort you;” and she stood
aside while he passed into his wife’s room,
closing the door behind him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X.<br> <span class='c009'>BASIL’S COMFORTER.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>There is a story told of a boy who, journeying
through a thick wood, prayed diligently that Providence
would deliver him from the dangers of
the forest, until at last the trees were left behind,
and the open country reached. Then said the
lad, breathing a deep sigh of relief, “That will
do; I can take care of myself now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>What the boy said, we feel—not merely in our
relations with the Almighty, but day by day in
our dealings with our fellows.</p>

<p class='c011'>While the danger is imminent, we are glad of
any assistance, of any help, but the moment the
wood is left behind, and safer ground reached,
we mentally echo the lad’s cry, and exclaiming,
“We can take care of ourselves now,” are glad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>to be rid of our benefactors, and think we never
can get the pilot fast enough off our decks—on
to his own.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not long before Phemie discovered that
Georgina, having got back her husband and
escaped his anger, desired to be rid of the instrument
who had brought about this result.</p>

<p class='c011'>Prospective gratitude, as I have often before
remarked, is one thing—retrospective another.
Prospectively, Mrs. Basil Stondon had promised
wonderful things to Phemie, if she did her
bidding; retrospectively she rather underrated
her services, and felt in the present jealous of
her influence and power over Basil.</p>

<p class='c011'>In those days if Phemie said “Go” to Basil
he went. The more he thought of the woman
whose life he had made so poor in happiness, the
more he loved her—not with the unholy love of
old—not with the passion which had scorched and
blighted the green verdure, and the fair flowers
of their once sweet Paradise—but soberly and
purely, as a worshipper might love a saint.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>He was not afraid of being with her now. He
did not feel her presence torture—the sight of
her a snare. No great human passion, unless
indeed it may be revenge, can live within sight
of death—and the way in which Phemie told
him of his calamity had cured Basil, and changed
him for life.</p>

<p class='c011'>In his vigil beside his boy the past came and
kept him company, and he repented him of the
evil, and wished unavailingly he could go back
through the years, and live them over again.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had made her a lonely, desolate woman—a
woman who in her widowhood could not even
take to her soul the poor consolation of having
done her duty faithfully by a husband she never
loved. He had broken Captain Stondon’s heart—he
had wakened him from a pleasant dream.
He had shown him the gold of the crown he
wore was to him but as valueless tinsel—the
gem he had prized so highly but glass in his
possession. From the old man he had snatched
away the last precious thing life held for him—faith
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>in his wife’s love—belief in her perfect
truth and purity. He was taken home and
warmed beside his hearth, and when he had
eaten his bread, and shared his affection, he
turned and stung his benefactor; and then he
left England, and the years had come and the
years had gone, and he was rich and respected—yet—should
he escape?</p>

<p class='c011'>If he had forgotten, had God? If his sin had
passed from his memory, like breath from the
surface of a mirror, did it follow that the sin was
forgiven? Though he had buried his fault—though
he had hidden it away from sight—though
the turf was green, and the roses blooming—there
was still the body of his fault lying
waiting for that resurrection which comes, even
in this world, at an hour men least expect it,
for the sins, and the follies, and the shortcomings,
and the commission and the omission
of their youth.</p>

<p class='c011'>Trouble makes a man reflect: like adversity,
it is a great teacher—and in the weary, weary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>hours that elapsed between his son’s death and
the funeral, Basil Stondon learned more than he
had ever done before, all his life long.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hitherto the tale which experience traces on
the memories of each of us had been to him as a
narrative in a strange tongue; but now he got
by degrees the clue to the mystery—the key to
the cypher, and read the story day by day
painfully and carefully. It had not been all a
confused jumble of events, sorrows, temptations,
joys, trials. Neither did it prove a disjointed
puzzle that would not piece together and make a
finished and perfect whole; but rather it was the
fulfilment of a great truth which, once forced upon
his attention, he had still elected to make light
of—“The wages of sin is death.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Painfully he patched the map of his life together,
and found those words traced across it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Death—not such death as had come to his
boy, not such peace and quiet, not such repose
and freedom from trouble, but death like what
had fallen upon Phemie—living death—death
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>to happiness, to hope, to the future. For
wages are paid that they may be spent; and
there can be no spending, no buying; no eating
and drinking, of the bread of bitterness, of the
waters of affliction, in the grave.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was clear to him at last. He should have to
bear as she had been forced to bear. She told
him this truth herself—not hardly or pharisaically,
not with the air of one who having been
a martyr glories in recounting his sufferings, but
pitifully and tearfully, across his son’s body;
and when the agony of this new light proved too
much for him, when he bowed his head and
covered his face and wept anew, she repeated to
him the burden of that which she had said to
herself before she went forth to seek him—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would God I could bear it for you; if it
might be, I would bear all gladly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish the punishment had fallen entirely
upon me,” he answered, humbly.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was much changed in those days—changed
towards his wife more especially, and yet Georgina
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>did not feel satisfied. She knew who had
wrought this alteration, even at her own request;
and that knowledge woke to life the old jealousy,
the old dislike, the old hatred of her successful
rival.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is quite time we were back at Roundwood,
uncle, I think,” said Phemie to her uncle, as
they walked together about the grounds on the
day preceding that fixed for the funeral.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We will go to-morrow if you like, dear,” he
answered. “You have done all you can do here.
Mrs. Basil Stondon is, doubtless, greatly attached
to you, and you have been of much use to her;
but yet I believe—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Of honey and of gall in love there is store,</div>
      <div class='line'>The honey is much—but the gall is more.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“I am sure there is more gall than honey in
her love for me,” replied Phemie; “and therefore,
although I do hope I have been of use
here, I will pack up and go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would, Phemie, I could see you packing up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>and making preparations for happiness on your
own account,” he said, significantly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You speak in enigmas,” was her reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do I? Let me try then to speak plainly to
you, Phemie. I would see you married, sweet.
I would have you try to give back love for love
to a worthy man who loves you dearly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who is he?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='c011'>“One who is much at Roundwood, who misses
no opportunity of visiting you, of talking with
you—who——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You mean Major Morrice, I conclude,” she
interrupted. “He is certainly much at Roundwood,
but for once your penetration has been at
fault. It is Helen he wants. I am forestalling
his petition, but you need take no notice of that
when he comes to present it. Only cease connecting
the idea of marriage and me, uncle, for
I wed no more till death woos me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Phemie, you grieve me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Grieve you, when I tell you a good man and
a true wants to marry your daughter, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>will ask you for her in due time. Uncle, it is
you who grieve me. I did not think you so
selfish and short-sighted.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She spoke laughingly, but he answered her
seriously.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Phemie, was there one of them I ever loved
better than you? Had you been my own flesh
and blood a hundred times over, could you have
been nearer to me than has been the case?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think not—I am positive not,” she said;
“but what then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, dear, because you are so dear to me,
I would see you happy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Happiness, uncle,” she answered, “is to be
compassed by the widow as by the wife—by the
childless as by the mother. I am happy now—believe
me, I speak the truth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And she stood on tiptoe and kissed his cheek
as she said this.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I told you I would find work to do,” she continued;
“and I mean to try and carry out my
idea: the girl’s lovers shall be mine—to paraphrase
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>the old Scotch song—their husbands
mine;—their children, my sons and daughters.
There is a child here I love very much,”
she went on, with a little hesitation; “a poor,
neglected child, I wish I had for mine very
own.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do not wish for her, Phemie;—other people
have more need of her than you,” Mr. Aggland
replied; and before Phemie left Norfolk she
knew he had advised her well.</p>

<p class='c011'>Next morning the child who so lately had
been regarded as heir to Marshlands, was borne
from its gates and laid in the Stondons’ vault,
close beside Phemie’s husband.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dust to dust—ashes to ashes. The words
were spoken, and the mourners returned.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We will go by the last train, and stop in
London for the night,” Mr. Aggland suggested;
and as he suggested, so Phemie agreed.</p>

<p class='c011'>When it was growing dark she went to
Georgina’s room, and bade her good-bye.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good-bye,” said Mrs. Basil Stondon, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>felt, it might be, some qualms of reproach at
seeing her unloved visitor depart according to
her secret desire. “Good-bye, and thank you a
hundred times over.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good-bye,” answered Phemie; “and if ever
you want my help again, come to me, Georgina,
for I shall never come to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why?” asked the mistress of Marshlands;
and Phemie replied—“You know why as well as
I do. Because you do not wish to have me
here; because it is well we should walk on our
separate paths, apart.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You always were peculiar,” observed Mrs.
Basil Stondon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was I?” replied Phemie. “At all events,
I always (unavailingly perhaps) tried to be
honest;” which retort silencing her enemy, she
put her lips to Phemie’s face and bade her farewell—not
sorrowing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Phemie then went to perform a harder task,
that of taking leave of Basil.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had shut himself in what was called the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>library after his return from the funeral, and
remained there the whole afternoon, refusing to
be comforted.</p>

<p class='c011'>Time after time Phemie gently knocked, but
still obtaining no answer she went up to the
nursery, and taking “Fairy” in her arms came
downstairs again and rapped on the panel
loudly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want to speak to you,” she said. “I must
speak before I go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He came across the room and unlocked the
door and gave her admittance, and then she
walked to a chair near the table at which he had
been sitting, and tried to induce him to take the
child from her arms, but he motioned her
away.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mamma—Mamma Phemie,” sobbed the little
girl in a passion of grief, hiding her face on
Phemie’s breast, “is he sorry it was not me?
Nurse says he is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Phemie looked at the father, who had heard
his child’s words—looked at him—and as Basil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>stretched out his hands, rose and gave him his
daughter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fay! Fay!” he cried, sobbing like a woman;
and he took the little creature to his heart, who
nestled there.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI.<br> <span class='c009'>CONFESSIONS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>The months went by, and there were changes
at Roundwood; such changes as Phemie had
prophesied. If Major Morrice’s wooing was
long, his wedding was speedy; and early in the
ensuing year he took his wife to her new abode.</p>

<p class='c011'>Was Olivia Derno forgotten? you ask, and I
answer No; but the man had his life to live
though she was dead, and he felt it no slight on
her memory to marry one who had known and
loved her.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a very good match for Helen. “Very
wonderful,” said Mrs. Keller, with her nose in the
air, “for a poor farmer’s daughter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind, Mrs. Keller,” observed Phemie,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>with that terrible knack of reading people’s
thoughts which her relative had noticed on the
occasion of her first visit. “Major Morrice would
have been almost too old a husband for any of
your girls, and we will see what we can do for
them yet. I think I have been a rather successful
match-maker.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At this Mrs. Keller bridled, and wondered
what Mrs. Stondon was talking about.</p>

<p class='c011'>“About your daughters,” answered Phemie
quietly. “You do not want them to live single
all their lives, I suppose; and if eligible husbands
offer, you will not say them nay. Had I
daughters, I should give them every opportunity
of falling in love I could devise——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My dear Mrs. Stondon!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My dear Mrs. Keller!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it not time enough,” said the latter lady,
“to consider these matters when a gentleman
proposes?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And treat marriage as an alliance between
two high and mighty powers, instead of an affair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>between man and woman,” answered Phemie.
“Just as you will. Let the girls come down here
and stay, taking their chance of meeting a good
husband, as they might of meeting a desirable
acquaintance; or keep them away, it is immaterial
to me; only, had I girls, I should give them
an opportunity of making their choice, and deciding
whom they loved best, before the irrevocable
words were spoken—the matrimonial Rubicon
crossed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Keller laughed, and said her hostess was
eccentric; but for all that she let her girls be
among the number of Helen’s bridemaids, and
felt quite a maternal flutter when she heard a
bachelor baronet was one of Major Morrice’s
dearest friends and his nearest neighbour.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the surprise of every one interested in the
matter, however, Duncan Aggland conceived a
most violent affection for the second Miss Keller,
and begged her mother to consider his request
favourably.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was not a baronet, and he was in business,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>but still the lady consented to ignore his trade
for the sake of his income.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are many engineers Members of Parliament,”
she remarked meditatively to Mrs.
Stondon, at which observation Phemie laughed
till she was weary.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pray do not put that idea into Duncan’s
mind,” she said, “or he will never attend to his
business;” and Mrs. Keller took the advice and
held her peace.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The birds are all on the wing, uncle,” she
said to Mr. Aggland one day, “and we shall soon
be left solitary;” but it was in a more cheerful
tone than formerly Phemie spoke. The days
brought their duties with them, and the due discharge
of daily duties ultimately ensures happiness
to the man or woman who tries to act
aright.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And it will soon be summer again,” Phemie
proceeded; “where shall we go this year?”</p>

<p class='c011'>They sat in the twilight of the spring evening
talking about this place, and about that; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>then as the darkness drew on the night became
cloudy, and the rain began to patter against the
window-panes. The wind rose also, and they
could hear the angry rush of the waves as they
came rolling up louder and louder upon the
shore.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Heaven have mercy on those who are out at
sea,” said Mr. Aggland, looking forth into the
gathering darkness, “for it is going to be a wild
night;” and at the words Phemie shivered with
the strange shivering of old.</p>

<p class='c011'>She moved to the piano and played the first
few bars of Handel’s “Lord, what is man?”
then she rose again and stirred the fire into a
blaze, and pulled the chairs into comfortable
positions, and turned the lamp up to a desirable
height, and then stood before the hearth meditatively.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sing for me, Phemie dear, if you are not
tired,” said her uncle, who knew that when these
restless moods came on, music was the best and,
indeed, the only sedative. “Sing for me a song
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>or a hymn, a ballad or a psalm—what you will,
only sing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Obediently she walked across the room and
began making melody. Now she sang, and
again she played; now it was “<cite><span lang="la">Ave Verum</span></cite>,” and
then she stopped abruptly and drew her hands
from the instrument, only to commence that
sonata of Beethoven’s which contains within its
leaves the Funeral march upon the death of a
Hero.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a night it is!” she broke off at last to
say, “do you hear the rain?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And how the wind is howling!” answered Mr.
Aggland; “it puts me in mind of the way it used
to come up the valley at Tordale, running like a
racehorse between the hills, and then flinging
itself against our door. Do you remember how
it beat for admittance—how it rattled against the
windows—how it screamed and shrieked, as if it
were a living thing, to be let in—only to be let
in?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” Phemie said, pursuing the same idea;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>“and how it used to go away, sobbing and moaning
like one in great pain, across the moor to
Strammer Tarn. I often thought in those days I
should have loved to be beside the Tarn when
the night wind came home there; I always felt
as though it lived among those great rocks and
boulders. Do you not wonder whether it is as
rough a night up in the Cumberland Hills as it is
down here by the coast? Do you wonder who is
living in the old place now, and whether they are
gathered close round the fire as we had a way of
gathering when the wind was howling at the
door?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I often think about the old place, Phemie,” he
said. “When I am sitting quietly here by your
fireside, dear, in such peace and comfort as I
once thought never to know, my fancy turns
many and many a time back to Tordale; it was
a sweet spot—ay, you might travel far to find
one lovelier—beautiful as Roundwood is, I never
can fancy it so perfect as Tordale. I wish we
had a drawing of the valley. I think I shall ask
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>Duncan, next time he is in the north, to bring
me a sketch of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She turned a little from the piano, and, leaning
her elbow on the keys, bade him go on and talk
to her about their Cumberland home—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Which I supposed we shall love best of all,”
she finished, “to the end.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” Mr. Aggland replied, “probably, for—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘This fond attachment to the well-known place,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whence first we started into life’s long race,</div>
      <div class='line'>Maintains its hold with such unfailing sway,</div>
      <div class='line'>We feel it e’en in age, and at our latest day.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>—But, mercy on us! how the rain is coming
down! I do not think I ever heard heavier rain
even in Cumberland;” and he rose as he spoke,
and, putting the curtains aside, looked out into
the night.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then there came a ring at the front door—a
peal, hurried, loud, and yet conveying the
idea of the bell having been pulled by an unsteady
hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who on earth can it be at this hour, and in
such a storm?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Phemie had started up as the peal echoed
through the house, and uncle and niece stood
looking apprehensively in each other’s faces
for a moment, wondering what could be
wrong.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It must be a message from one of the boys,”
said Mr. Aggland, hurrying next instant to the
drawing-room door; but before he could reach it
a servant announced Mr. Basil Stondon, and that
gentleman entered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a night for you to choose,” exclaimed
Mr. Aggland.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What have you got there?” asked Phemie,
pointing to something which lay hidden under
Basil’s coat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A trifle for you to take care of for me,” he
answered, “if you will;” and he put the rough
covering gently aside, and showed her Fay lying
fast asleep in his arms.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Basil”—Phemie could not find another word
to say to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the meaning of it?” Mr. Aggland
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>asked. “Is your wife ill—are you mad—or is
she dead?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is dead to me,” Basil answered; “take
my child, Phemie, and let me go; I only came to
ask you to be kind to her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The water was absolutely dripping off him
as he spoke—he stood in a little pool in the
centre of the room—outside, the rain was pouring
down in torrents, and mingling with the noise
of the rain was the howling of the wind and the
rushing sound upon the shore, of the not far
distant sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go up to my uncle’s room and change your
clothes directly,” was Phemie’s unromantic comment
on this explanation; “give me the child.
Basil, you are mad.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For some time he stood it out with her that he
would neither change his dripping garments nor
remain in Roundwood even for the night.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where are you going?” asked Phemie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have no plan; I am not sure; I do not know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, then, I do,” she interrupted. “You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>will go direct off to bed, and take something at
once to prevent your catching your death of
cold.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was not cold,” he persisted. “He was
burning with heat—he had walked over from the
station carrying Fay—and——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Took off your top-coat to keep her dry,” again
interrupted Phemie; “the consequence of which
will be that if you do not take immediate care of
yourself, you will be seriously ill.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He did not mind that—he should like to be
ill—he should like to die. If it had not been
for Fay, he would first have shot Georgina,
and then himself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What has she done?” asked Phemie, hushing
the child, who, having been awakened by the
light and the talking, had begun to cry.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She has been false to me,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nonsense,” retorted Phemie. “Basil, you
are mad, as I said before.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps so; but a thing like that is enough
to make a man feel a little discomposed;” and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>thrust a letter into her hand, which she held
unopened while she said:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now be reasonable, and listen to me.
Standing in your wet clothes, or wandering about
the country, will not mend matters in the least.
Unless you do what I ask you, I will not
take care of Fay; I will not even put her
to bed, nor take charge of her for a single
night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But why should I remain?” he began;
which sentence Phemie cut short by directing a
meaning glance towards her uncle, who at once
laid his hand on Mr. Stondon’s arm and led
him from the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Phemie rang for her maid, and gave
Fay into her charge, after which she unfolded
the missive Basil had left with her, and
read one of the most glowing and tender loveletters
it had ever fallen to her lot to peruse.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her first idea was that her senses must be
playing her some trick; her next was a purely
feminine wonder as to what manner of man could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>have become so desperately enamoured of Georgina
Stondon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“After that,” said Mistress Phemie to herself,
“I will never disbelieve in witchcraft again;”
and she remained standing beside the fire, not so
much shocked as astonished—lost, in fact, in
such a labyrinth of amazement and conjecture as
completely bewildered her senses.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would not have believed it, Basil,” she
said, “if I had not seen it; and I do not
believe it yet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Aggland brought their unexpected guest
downstairs again to the drawing-room, and then
left him and his niece to talk the matter over
together.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I quite agree with you, Phemie, that he is
mad,” he whispered ere he went; “but he will
be better in the morning if you can only induce
him to eat something and go quietly to bed.
Let him talk—it will do him good.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Having received which piece of advice, Phemie
went back to the man she had once loved so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>passionately, and spoke to him the words I have
written.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would not have believed it had I not seen
it, and I do not believe it yet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked up at her with a sad, hopeless
expression in his face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She did not deny it, and I gave her the
chance of doing so.”</p>

<p class='c011'>What could any one say in reply to this?
Even Phemie stood mute; while he went on
angrily:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“What did I ever do, that she should have
played me false? Have I not been a good
husband to her? Has she not had wealth and
standing? Was she not poor, and did I not
make her rich? If we did quarrel at times, it
was all her own fault. Since—since Harry died,
I swear to you, Phemie, I never have spoken a
cross word to her—never. I have tried to live
at peace with her. If I had been like other
husbands——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Basil, stop!—oh, Basil, stop!” Phemie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>cried out shrilly, like one in some bodily pain;
for, as he spoke, there came up before her the
memory of another husband very unlike Basil
indeed—a husband who had taken a young girl
from poverty and drudgery to raise her to wealth
and station—a husband who had never looked
coldly on her—a husband who stood between his
wife and the world—who had been so careful of
her reputation that he would not acknowledge
even to her that her purity was in peril—who
removed the stumbling-block from her path,
and the snare from her feet—and then grew
suddenly old and infirm, and died bearing
his burden of sorrow to the grave with him
patiently.</p>

<p class='c011'>Till she heard this man vaunting himself—this
poor, weak, selfish sinner thanking God that he
was not as other sinners—it had never fully
come home to her what a great heart it was he
and she had mutually broken—what a grand
nature they had tricked and deceived.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the dagger had found the vulnerable point
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>at last, and every nerve in Phemie’s body thrilled
with pain as she implored of him to stop.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment he stared at her in surprise,
but then he knew how he had hurt her—how and
where; and a dead silence ensued—a silence
like that which fell between them when she took
her place opposite to his in the railway carriage,
and told him there was no need to hurry.</p>

<p class='c011'>During that pause each fought out a mental
battle, and then, when they had waged their conflict,
beaten down separately the phantoms that
came up to reproach them, Phemie turned to
Basil and said calmly, as though that cry of
irrepressible agony had never escaped her lips:</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is no name. Have you any idea who
it is?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not the least,” he answered; “but I will
know; I will find it out; I will free myself and
my child from her—I will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, you shall not,” Phemie interrupted. “Let
Georgina be what she may, you shall not do this
thing until, at all events, you have had time to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>think over the matter calmly and justly. You
shall hold your peace about her; you shall make
no scandal; you have been mad enough in
coming here in this fashion to-night, and bringing
Fairy with you, and talking before the child as
you have done; but that is all the more reason
why you should be quiet and prudent now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She calmed him down by degrees, and after a
time, although she could not get him to go to
bed, she did induce him to eat something, and to
sit down before the fire, “like a rational being,”
as she observed.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he thought Mr. Stondon must have had
ample time to say his say, Mr. Aggland re-entered
the room, and urged upon him the desirability of
his at once swallowing a certain decoction of
herbs, which would, so that gentleman assured
him, prevent his having to retire into what Charles
Lamb calls “that regal solitude, sickness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should like to be sick,” retorted the other,
pettishly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Should you?” said Mr. Aggland; “’twould
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>be a pity, then, to balk so reasonable a fancy;”
and he leaned back in his chair and gave over
the patient, who remained looking steadfastly at
the fire, while from a little distance Phemie contemplated
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was a young man no longer; his youth,
like her own, had flitted by, leaving no outward
traces of its former presence. He was not the
Basil Stondon who had come to her beside
Strammer Tarn, brushing his way through the
heather to the spot she occupied. He was
middle-aged, and worn and haggard, not in the
least resembling the dream-hero who had crossed
the hills too late—too late.</p>

<p class='c011'>When she thought of that hero, Phemie could
see the man no more for the tears that blinded
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dreams, friends—dreams! I wonder if we
ever shed such bitter tears when the realities of
our lives are destroyed and the once sure earth
cut from beneath our feet, as we do when, in
a mist-wreath, the air-castle vanishes—when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>once limitless lands of our fairy kingdom disappear
in the depths of the ocean, and are lost to
our sight for ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>Prosperous as her life had proved, Phemie at
any rate found it hard to look back upon the
dreams and fantasies of her girlish days with
equanimity.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had been thinking much of Tordale and
the Hill Farm—of the old old life—of the beauty
of that secluded valley—of the Church—of the
waterfall, of the mountains and the fells—before
Basil broke in upon her reminiscences; and now
she could not help bringing his figure as she
remembered it into the mental picture likewise—she
could not avoid recalling <em>that</em> day—when,
among the glorious sights and sounds of summer,
he crossed the hills in order to tell her all his
love.</p>

<p class='c011'>Strammer Tarn at that moment was more real
to her than her luxuriously furnished room at
Roundwood. Basil—the dream-hero Basil, the
careless, handsome, thoughtless, wicked, and yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>not intentionally wicked sinner—was more real to
her than Georgina’s husband. She, herself, was
for the moment no widow—no worn, changed
woman—but a wife in the full flush of her beauty,
resisting the temptation to which that very
beauty had exposed her, trying to stand firm
against his love and her own.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was all like a story to her that night, like a
real tale of another person’s life, and I think the
Phemie who was no longer young, and who had
passed through much suffering, and who knew
that no temptation could come to her to shake
her more, felt sorry for that far-away figure
which, crouching among the heather and the
grass and the wild thyme, wept passionately.</p>

<p class='c011'>Does the tale grow wearisome, reader?—are
these particulars too minute?</p>

<p class='c011'>If they be, bear with me still a little, I pray,
for the story is drawing to its end; the last page
will soon be reached, the final touch given to the
figures we have been studying, the volume completed,
the book closed and laid aside; and before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>that end is reached, I would have you take in
the retrospect of Phemie Keller’s life as she took
it in, and regard her, as for one moment she
regarded the girl, and the woman, she beheld
standing young and fanciful and foolish—young
and beautiful and tempted—pityingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>But not one half so much pity did she feel for
that former self, as she did for the man who sat
by her hearth, whose punishment had fallen upon
him so late.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thinking of the Basil she had known—thinking
of all he might have made of his life—of his
opportunities—of his position—of his friends—of
his winning manners—of his frank, free,
generous disposition—Phemie thought her heart
must break for very pity, for very remorse, to
remember she had ever a hand in bringing about
so poor an ending to a once promising story.</p>

<p class='c011'>How might a woman like herself, had she only
been true, and kept him from loving her, or
changed his unholy love into respect and trust
and admiration, not have moulded such a nature.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>He had loved Miss Derno, and yet Miss Derno
came in time to be the best friend, the most
faithful adviser his manhood ever knew.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! if I had only loved him less, or loved
my husband more,” thought the poor soul, as a
finish to her own bitter reflections; “<em>this</em> need
never have come upon him; he might have stayed
in England and married a different wife, and
been happy instead of wretched; useful in his
generation, instead of a mere cumberer of the
ground.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When she had arrived at this point in her
argument, Basil came back from his mental
journey, wherever it had taken him, and speaking
like a man wakened suddenly from sleep, said
that he thought he should like to bid her goodnight,
that he was beginning to feel very chilly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You had better take my prescription,”
observed Mr. Aggland; and Basil did take the
dose, which proved impotent, however, to work
the cure its discoverer promised it should effect,
for next morning he was so ill he could not rise,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>and before the following night fever set in, and
for a time all his troubles were forgotten.</p>

<p class='c011'>He raved frantically indeed, but not about his
sorrows; as is often the case, his mutterings
contained no reference to the cause of his illness;
he wandered in imagination, not through the
night carrying his child with him, not across the
seas to seek his fortune, not over the hills to
find Phemie, blue-eyed and auburn-haired; but
backwards and forwards—to and fro in a land
full of strange fancies—of mad vagaries—of
unreal horrors—of fearful delusions—of horrible
spectres.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very rapidly he got worse, so rapidly, indeed,
that before Mrs. Montague Stondon could be
written to and arrive from Paris, which capital
she was then honouring with her presence, the
doctors had begun to look very grave, and, to
adapt an old saying to present use, although they
hoped the best, evidently believed the worst.</p>

<p class='c011'>When it came to that, Phemie declared that,
let the consequences be what they might, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>should send for his wife; and Georgina was sent
for accordingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Almost before Phemie thought it possible she
could arrive, Mrs. Basil Stondon reached Roundwood,
reached it with the cold hardness, with the
insolent sarcasm beaten and pinched out of her
face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why did you not write to me before?” she
asked, almost fiercely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because I was not certain whether I ought
to write at all,” Phemie replied.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then he came straight to you: I might have
known he would; and Fay is here also, I suppose;
and—he showed you the letter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He did, but we will not talk about that now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But we will talk of it, if you please. You
believed in that letter, I suppose—you mourned
over my shortcomings—you sympathised with
a man who was tied to so wicked a wife—you
dreamed perhaps of a divorce, and thought it
within the bounds of probability that Basil
Stondon and Euphemia Stondon might one day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>stand before the altar. Did you? I hope you
did, for the letter was a sham! Ay, you may
look at me,” she went on with a hysterical
laugh. “I wrote it every word myself, and I
left it in his way on purpose to see if I could
rouse any feeling in him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What an idiot you must be, Georgina,”
exclaimed Phemie, indignantly; “what a senseless,
wicked, foolish, childish trick it was. If he
dies, his death will be at your door. How could
you do it?—how came such a plan ever to enter
your mind?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“One cannot live near ice and not desire to
thaw it,” was the reply; “may I see him?” she
added, more humbly; “would it do him any
harm if I spoke to him for a moment?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He will not know who you are,” the elder
woman answered; and she led the way to where
Basil lay, his wife following.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then for the first time Phemie understood
that Georgina loved her husband with all her
heart, and soul, and strength; that all through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>their married life the attachment had been on
her side, that she would have done anything to
secure his affection, had she known how; that it
would, as she declared, kill her if his illness
proved fatal.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did more to win his heart than ever you
could have done,” she said, when at last Phemie
had dragged her from the sick-chamber. “I
would have gone through fire and water for him,
but he never loved me—never!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He must have loved you, or he would not
have married you,” Phemie answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I made him marry me,” was the reply. “He
married me because I loved him; do you understand
that, Mrs. Stondon—you, who were so cold,
and so prudent, and so selfish? If I had been in
your place, if I had been married fifty times, I
would have left my husband for his sake. If he
had loved me as he loved you, I would have
quitted Marshlands had he held up his finger
for me to come. I nursed him,”—she continued,
speaking hurriedly and excitedly,—“I nursed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>him all through that illness he had in India. I
brought him back from death. He could not
have lived but for my care. It is no light thing,
let me tell you, tending a man through a long
sickness out in that climate, and when he got
better I was like a ghost; but he knew I loved
him,—knew no woman could have done what I
did had she not loved him, and he married me,
and I thought I had won the battle at last.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And afterwards,” Phemie suggested, as the
speaker paused.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Afterwards!” repeated Mrs. Basil Stondon.
“You want me to go on and tell you how you
beat me at every move—how it was your men on
the board prevented my winning the game. So
be it. The game has not been all profit to you
either, so I must rest satisfied.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For pity’s sake,” entreated Phemie, “forget
that he ever was fond of me; let the dead past
lie: it was never so fair or pleasant that you
need be continually taking off the coffin-lid to
look at it.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>“Don’t talk to me about coffins,” exclaimed
Georgina, with a shudder, “and he so ill; and
as for your request, I would let the past lie if I
could. I would bury it half a mile deep, and
never desire to hear of it again, if you and he
would only let me; but is it in a woman’s nature—cold
as you are, I put it to you, would it be
even in yours—to see a stranger preferred before
you—to feel that she is seated in the innermost
chamber while you are shivering outside on the
doorstep?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It would not,” Phemie answered; “but then
I am not in the innermost chamber, so there is
no use in making yourself miserable about the
matter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you are not, who is?” demanded Mrs.
Basil Stondon; and Phemie remained silent
for very want of the ability to answer the question.
“If you had not been, would he have come
to you with that letter?—would he have rushed
straight as he did from me to you? Go back
over your own life. When Captain Stondon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>found out that you and Basil were so fond
of one another, what did he do? Did he fly
from you as he might from a pestilence? Did
he publish the story to Miss Derno, or any
other miss or madam in the kingdom? Did
he?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” replied Phemie; “but then my husband
was a very different man to yours.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“True,” said Mrs. Basil Stondon, “he was a
very different man, and a very much better.
You had a good husband, if you had only known
how to value him; but still, good or not, different
or not different, had Basil loved me he
never would have come to you. It was my last
attempt; now I throw up the cards.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And when Georgina concluded, she made a
movement as of flinging something from her, and
turned sullenly aside.</p>

<p class='c011'>Finding, however, that Phemie did not speak,
she faced round again and asked,—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you got nothing to remark on all that?
When Basil gave you his version you were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>surely not so dumb?” But still Phemie made no
reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was wondering whether she should ever
be able to reconcile this pair—whether any interference
of hers might produce some good result—whether,
if he lived, she could bring about some
better understanding—whether, if he died, he
would first recover sufficiently to speak kindly to
his wife ere he departed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you going to open your lips again to-day?”
persisted Mrs. Basil Stondon; and at last
Phemie answered, while she rose and laid her
hand gently on Georgina:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes. I am going to ask you, why you will
persist in regarding me as your enemy? When
I followed Basil into Yorkshire—when I brought
him home with me—when I broke the bad news
to him in such a way that he never had an angry
feeling towards you in consequence, was I your
enemy? Was I not, at all events, only doing
your bidding—only trying to accomplish what
you wanted, to the best of my ability?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>“Yes; but it seemed so hard for such interference
to be necessary,” said Georgina, softening
a little.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was that my fault? He married you; why
he married you is quite beside the question; he
did marry you, and for years you had him all to
yourself. I should not care if a man had loved
fifty women before he made me his wife. If I
could not turn them all out, and keep the citadel
against them, I should say I did not deserve to
have it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And does the same rule hold good with
regard to husbands, Mrs. Stondon?” asked the
other, maliciously.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We were talking of wives, not of husbands,”
answered Phemie; and continued: “Feeling as
you did towards me, why did you ever ask me
to Marshlands?—why did you press me to stay
there?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because I was weary of my life—because
you were better than nobody—because it looked
well—because it tormented Basil—stop; let me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>go back to the beginning, where you interrupted
my story. I do not mind showing you my hand,
now the game is over. We were married, as I
told you; the mutiny broke out, and we were
bound still closer by the feeling of a common
danger; besides, he was grateful to me. Oh!
yes, he was grateful, for he set great store by his
life, and I had saved it! My father was killed,
as you heard, and Basil was sorry for my loss.
Altogether, though I knew he did not love me
even then, still we got on very well for a time,
and the only quarrel we had originated in his
obstinate refusal to write to Captain Stondon
and tell him of his marriage.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘You are afraid of <em>him</em> letting <em>her</em> know, I
suppose,’ I was provoked at last into saying.
That was my first downrightly bad move, and you
were the occasion of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘It was your doing, then, that I had to leave
Marshlands,’ he answered on the instant, almost
indeed before I had time to wish my own words
unspoken, ‘how did you manage it?’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>“I told him all—I did really—all that you have
assured me came to your knowledge after you
were left a widow. I could not help writing that
note. I would have done anything to part you—anything
to get him out to India with us—I was
so fond of him; but he put it all down to love of
Marshlands; and so, when at last news came to
us of your husband’s death, he turned to me and
said, ‘You have got that which you schemed for so
well and so long; I wish you joy of it.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“There was something else, though, in his mind
at the moment—something I read out of his face
that I knew he would not have put into words
for anything; but I did for him. I said, ‘You
are thinking she is free, and I am bound. I am
bound, and she is free!’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have mercy, Georgina!”—It was Phemie
who entreated this boon. She was turning faint
and sick at such a thought being put before him
in its naked deformity; but Georgina’s answer
made her stand erect and defiant once more.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you think, if I had not mercy on him, I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>going to take pity on you?” she asked. “I told him
his thought in so many words. I taunted him with
it, and then we had a fearful quarrel—the first of our
new series, which has never ceased from that day
to this. It was then he informed me of the pleasant
ban you had laid upon him—almost exultingly
he spoke of how your words had come true—of
how, although you might never be to him what I
was, yet that still you would always be something
nearer and dearer by far. He did not spare
me a pang, you may depend upon it. Then I
learned what was in my husband; I have never
unlearned that knowledge since.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am very sorry,”—Phemie uttered this sentence
humbly—“forgive me, Georgina, my share
in your misery. What you tell me is very terrible—it
must have been dreadful for you to bear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did not bear it,” was the quick reply; “I
did not even regard it as payment for breaking
the heart of a better man, than ever you were a
woman. I battled against it; I was hard, and
he was harder; I would not accept my position,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>and he scoffed at me when I tried to alter it.
We came back to England, and he wanted to
travel down to Marshlands alone; but I had a
suspicion we should find you there, and I was
resolved not to lose the sight of that interview
at any rate. I had the advantage, so far as he
was concerned, for he really felt afraid to meet
you, and it was a triumph for the time being.
Next to getting the thing one wants for one’s
self, the greatest pleasure in life is seeing another
disappointed in getting it also. Altogether,”
proceeded Mrs. Basil Stondon, “I fancy I got the
best in that matter. Had I not been present,
there would have been opportunity for some
tender passages between Basil and yourself.
What is wrong, now?” she added, as Phemie
suddenly moved aside, and drew her hand away,
and shook her dress, seeming to think there
must be contagion in the very touch of her companion’s
garments.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII.<br> <span class='c009'>PHEMIE EXPRESSES HER OPINIONS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>“What is wrong?” repeated Mrs. Stondon,
her indignation breaking bounds at last, “only
this, Georgina, that if you marvel why you have
never been able to win Basil’s love, I do not.
How one woman could speak to another as you
have spoken to me this day I cannot comprehend.
What you must be made of to say the things, to
utter the taunts, to inflict the wounds you have
done, passes my understanding. I used to blame
your husband for his neglect and unkindness. I
do not blame him now. My sole wonder is that
he has stayed with you at all. I should not have
done it had I been in his place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You know nothing about me,” returned Georgina,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>who was more astonished and subdued by
the foregoing speech than she would have cared
to acknowledge—“and therefore you cannot
understand my feelings. You never loved him as
I did.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I never did,” Phemie answered, “and I
thank Heaven for it. All the love you are capable
of feeling for any one is very poor and mean and
selfish; and, as I said before, if you think a nature
such as yours is one calculated to win love from
man, woman, or child, you are greatly mistaken.
The man is not in existence, at least I hope he is
not, who would not come in time to hate a woman
that could deliberately inflict such suffering on
another woman as you have forced me to endure
to-day, and many a day before—many and many
a day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Was it true—were these words, which, in the
very extremity of her passion and anguish, escaped
from Mrs. Stondon’s lips, as true as Heaven?
Georgina had heard similar words before spoken
by her husband, and the very remembrance of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>fact lent additional bitterness to her tone as she
exclaimed—</p>

<p class='c011'>“And have I endured nothing at your hands?
Is it nothing to have had you standing between
me and him every hour since we were married—to
know he has never regarded me save as an
encumbrance, a burden; to feel he loved your
little finger better than my whole body?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I could not help that,” Phemie returned. “If,
knowing what you knew, you chose to marry him,
I am not to be held responsible for the unhappiness
of either of you. Had it been in my power
to make him give affection to you, he should have
done it. I did not want to keep the heart of any
woman’s husband. I would not have taken from
you a grain of his love, could any act of mine
have prevented his wasting it upon me. I have
never asked for it. I have never sought it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not even when you stayed at Marshlands to
welcome him home, I suppose,” remarked Georgina;
and there was a moment’s pause ere Mrs.
Stondon replied—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>“It was foolish for me to stay; foolish and
weak; but yet, when the grave gives up its victim,
when the sea returns its dead, can we stop to
argue about wisdom and propriety? I did wrong
in remaining, but I did not remain with any purpose
of trying to revive the past between us, I
only waited to bid him welcome home before I
left Marshlands for ever.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course,” remarked Georgina drily—“you
told us that at the time, and made your exit with
singular felicity, I admit; but still it strikes me that
had it not been for my appearance——Shall I
go on, or will you supply the rest of the sentence
for yourself?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You can go on, or you can remain silent,
whichever seems most agreeable,” answered
Phemie. Remaining at Marshlands was the one
part of her conduct since her husband’s death
which she had always feared to analyse too
exactly, which she could neither explain to another
nor defend to herself; it was the weak point in
her armour, and she could not hinder this woman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>stabbing her through it, again and again. She
remembered all she had felt when she beheld
Georgina’s bright mocking eyes looking at her
distress. She was never likely to forget the dull
horrid shock of that apparition, nor the first sight
of <em>their</em> child, nor the despairing misery of her
heart as she travelled away through the night,
reciting to her own soul every line of the weary
story which I have endeavoured throughout the
course of the preceding pages to tell.</p>

<p class='c011'>But for that one error of stopping to greet
the man whom she ought to have avoided, his
wife could have had no power over her now. Even
as it was, however, Phemie fought out her fight
bravely, and continued—</p>

<p class='c011'>“You can put any construction on my conduct
that pleases you; it is perfectly immaterial to me
whether you believe I stayed for the purpose of
winning Basil, as you would have done, or remained
for the simple reason I have before stated, as was
really and truly the case. You can think I am
like you or like myself, whichever you choose. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>shall enter into no further explanation or discussion,
but only repeat what I said at first, that I
never sought Basil’s love, and you know in your
heart that I speak the truth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is a truth difficult to grasp,” was Georgina’s
reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Most truths are difficult to grasp,” agreed
Mrs. Stondon; “it is very difficult for me now to
believe that, feeling as you say you have always
done towards me, it was of your own free will you
asked us to join our party to yours at Ambleside;
of your own free will you renewed the acquaintanceship
which had been allowed so completely
to drop; of your own free will, and at your own
special and earnest invitation, repeated over and
over again, not merely verbally but in writing, I
went to visit you at Marshlands; of your own free
will you almost forced me to remain with you
when I really desired to return home; of your
own free will you sent me a long journey into
Yorkshire to bring back the husband you have
since then alienated again from you by your senseless,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>childish folly. Truths such as these are hard
to grasp, but still they are truths for all that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Phemie, as she concluded this pleasant
sentence, reared up her head with a certain
haughty defiance, and looked down on Georgina,
who, remembering at the moment all this disdainful
woman might still be able to do for her,
stretched out her hand and tried to draw Mrs.
Stondon back into her former position.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Stondon’s temper was up, however; and
she therefore disengaged her dress, and moved
a little farther away from her visitor—who said,
deprecating,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I always liked you for yourself;—that may
explain much which has seemed to you inexplicable.
When you did not come between me and
Basil, I was as fond of you as I ever was of any
one, except him; but it is not easy—no wife ever
does find it easy—to endure a stranger’s interference.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did I want to interfere?” Phemie retorted.
“Whose doing was it that I ever had the misfortune
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>to meddle in your affairs at all? Did I
kill your child? Did I wish to go running
about the country after your husband? Do you
think it was any pleasure to me travelling by
night, and walking over those horrid moors, and
begging at strange houses for help, horses and
messengers, from the hands of strangers, in
order that I might find, and bring him to you
speedily? Would any woman on earth have
started on such an errand of her own inclination?
Do you imagine I enjoyed that return journey
with him? Can you not conceive that it was
torture—absolute torture—telling him about his
son’s death?—that the task you set me was a very
difficult one, and proved by no means easy of
accomplishment?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you could only imagine what he has been
like since!” observed Georgina.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, he told me he had never spoken a cross
word to you from that day to this;—that he had
given you no ground, not the slightest, for——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know what you mean—the letter. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>spoke truly—and yet—and yet—is there not a
worse unkindness than harshness? I would
rather have quarrelled with him fifty times a day,
than live with him as we have lived together
lately. He never has said a cross word. He
told me he had promised you he would not.
He only grew perfectly indifferent. I never, in
fact, saw him from morning until night,—and
then all at once I thought I would see if nothing
could move him—if I could not work him up
into a fury, if I could not wring one word of
affection from him. I grew sick of seeing him
and Fairy,—he so fond of her—she so fond of
him. If he had only given <em>me</em> a little love, I
should not have minded—I should not, indeed,
so much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She turned her eyes, as she finished this sentence—not
on Phemie, but out upon the lawn;
and Mrs. Stondon could not avoid seeing the
pained worn look there was in her once bright
countenance—the pinched expression I have
mentioned before, about her cheeks and mouth.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>“All my life long,” she began again, and the
tears came trickling slowly down her face,
“I never loved anything but him—never. Whom
had I to love?—neither brother nor sister nor
mother: perhaps I should not have cared for
them, had I possessed them all; but I was never
tried. There was no one in the world to care
for me excepting my father, and he lived in
India; and if he had been in England, you
know what he was. Often and often I wonder
what you would have been like, had you been
brought up like me;—what I should have been
like, had I been born and lived my life among
those Agglands. I think I might have been
different. I am confident you would.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is not impossible,” said Phemie, coldly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was always at school—always either there
or with my father’s sisters, who were, I do think,
the most horrid old women on earth. When I
went down into Norfolk, and stayed with the
Hurlfords, it was like getting into Paradise—they
were so different to the people I had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>used to; and yet still you know they are nothing
very particular in the way of amiability either.
I had met Basil before. I was so happy to be
near him: but I hated Miss Derno; and afterwards
I hated you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you,” said Phemie; “truth is best,
even if it be disagreeable.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I loved you; indeed, indeed I did, till I
found out Basil cared for you. Believe it or
not, just as you choose—I did love you, if it
was only for the opportunities you gave me of
meeting him; but when I saw how it was between
you, I thought I should go mad. I could
have torn your hair out by the roots, I was so
jealous of it. I felt glad when everybody said
you would be disfigured for life after that accident.
It was so hard—oh! it was so hard—when
you had such a husband, and after Basil
had paid me attentions. Do justice to me in that
matter, Mrs. Stondon. Might not any girl have
thought——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was in love with her—certainly,” answered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>Phemie. “I never saw Basil speak to a girl
excepting tenderly; but I do not think he was
more tender to you than to others. If he had, I
believe I should have noticed it;” and the speaker
adjusted her white linen cuff with an appearance
of careless indifference, while Georgina exclaimed—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do not be cruel, too—do not—do not!
What is the use of being superior, as people call
you, to our weaknesses and foibles—what is
the use of standing where you do, if you cannot
afford to forgive and be generous with a woman
like me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it you require, Georgina?” asked
Mrs. Stondon. “What is it you want? I told
you when we parted at Marshlands I would help
you if I could, and I will help you; but I cannot
be your friend. I can forgive, but it is no such
easy matter to forget.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And the cuff was buttoned over again. She
unfastened it while she was speaking, and then
employed her leisure in settling it to her satisfaction.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>It was an aggravating piece of apparel
to Basil’s wife, for somehow it placed her at a
disadvantage in the <i><span lang="fr">tête-à-tête</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will allow me to remain here—till—he
is either better or worse,” she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Assuredly. Did I not write, requesting you
to do so?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And when he gets well, you will tell him
about that letter, and——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I cannot do that. I will not meddle
in your affairs any more. I will never place
myself again in such a position that I can be
accused of making love to any woman’s husband.
Besides, you will tell him a much better story
than I could.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Surely you believe me when I say it was all
my own doing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My knowledge of your skill in letter-writing
is so great that I feel no difficulty in crediting
your singular statement. The fact is,” proceeded
Mrs. Stondon, suddenly changing her
tone, “you have placed yourself in a most difficult
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>position with a man whom it is well-nigh
impossible to persuade, and you must try to get
out of this scrape for yourself. There is time
enough, however, for you to think over the
matter, for there is no possibility of any immediate
change; and even when he does get better,
you must not harass him with your confessions
till he is strong enough to bear them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And if he speaks to you on the subject——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall tell him what I think—that a woman
who could act as you have done is only fit for
Bedlam. And now,” added Phemie, “had you
not better go to your own room for a little while
and rest after your journey? I will send Marshall
to you in case you require anything.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do not send her. I require nothing—except—except——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What?” asked Phemie, icily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your forgiveness and your friendship.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nonsense!” returned Mrs. Stondon. “You
want neither one nor the other, Georgina.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>There is no use in trying to impose upon me.
When you can wipe out the memory of the words
you have spoken this day, you will then perhaps
be able to persuade me you value the friendship
or affection of any woman, but not till then.
Nay, do not go on your knees to me—it is
perfectly unnecessary and extremely ridiculous.
Pray get up,” she entreated; “some of the servants
may come in, or my uncle, and it does
look so excessively absurd. Pray get up;” and
almost by force Phemie raised her visitor from
the floor, and went with her to her room, and
left her in an easy-chair with—to quote Mrs.
Stondon—“an embroidered handkerchief smelling
of millefleurs held to her face, and an evident
inclination to weep abundantly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I told her it would be the very best way
possible for her to employ her time,” said Mrs.
Stondon to her uncle, as they stood together in
the dining-room. “Of course, she thinks me a
hard-hearted Goth; but I mean to teach Mrs.
Basil Stondon that she shall not be insolent to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>me with impunity, and that I will not endure
such speeches as she has made to-day patiently
from anyone on earth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Phemie, Phemie, the woman is in great
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She has brought it on herself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Does that make it any easier to bear?”
asked Mr. Aggland.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And after all I did for her,” went on Mrs.
Stondon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You ought to forget your own good deeds,
dear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Uncle, you are unreasonable—you expect me
to be more than human; you think I should bear—bear—and
never give back an answer—that I
should endure to be put upon, and trampled
under foot, and made use of, by anyone who
likes to come and say, ‘I have need of you.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because, Phemie, it may be that they only
come as messengers—that it is really God who
has need of you. My child, did you not once say
you would try to do whatever work He gave you?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>And is not endurance oftentimes as much His
work as leading armies or commanding fleets?
Be patient with this poor wayward soul, who
goes wandering on, making herself and other
people wretched—unknowing how to compass
what she wants. Remember that charity not
only ‘suffereth long and is kind,’ but that it ‘is
not easily provoked; that it beareth all things;
hopeth all things; endureth all things.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am no saint,” she said, a little sullenly; for
Georgina had “put her out” thoroughly—had
chafed and angered and hurt her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did anybody ever think you were, Phemie?”
he asked; and the <i><span lang="fr">naïve</span></i> question made her laugh
a little. “I am positive I never did,” he continued;
“but I tell you what I do think, Phemie—that
you ought to stand far above such petty
annoyance. If you cannot bear indignity patiently,
who can? If you will not be generous,
where shall I turn and seek for magnanimity?—</p>

<p class='c013'>I will not quote any more of the lines, because
I do not much approve the spirit of those

earnestly and very pathetically, “you have been
mercifully dealt with: will you not deal mercifully
by another?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She bent her head till her brow touched the
marble chimney-piece, but did not answer for a
moment. Then—“You are not going to be hard
and unforgiving, are you?” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, uncle; I was only thinking,” she replied—“thinking
of a remark Georgina made.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should forget it at once,” he recommended.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was nothing unpleasant—nothing disagreeable,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>answered his niece. “She only said she
often wondered what she would have been had
she been brought up like me. She seems to
imagine her education has made her what
she is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ay, poor thing, ay!” exclaimed Mr. Aggland,
pityingly. He always felt very sorry for a
woman who had been brought up, as he phrased
it, “in the world,” and was quite willing to be of
Mrs. Basil Stondon’s opinion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is a reverse side to the question also,”
he said, continuing the idea; for education was a
hobby it delighted him to ride. “Had you been
brought up as she was, Phemie, how would it
have fared with you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Better perhaps, uncle,” she replied; but he
shook his head and declared she knew she was
answering him idly, “for you must believe there
is something in early training,” he added, “something
in the bending of the twig”—something
in hearing when very young of that which makes
men,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>‘Ply their daily task with busier feet,</div>
      <div class='line'>Because their hearts some holy strain repeat.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>At the same time, however,” finished Mr. Aggland,
“I incline greatly to the opinion that
he who said ‘characters are nurtured best on
life’s tempestuous sea,’ was right also; but this
poor creature seems neither to have had one
experience nor the other. You will be kind to
her, Phemie. Remember, he may not live—think
how soon she may be left a widow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Stondon did not require that last argument
to induce her to return to her guest’s room
and beg for admittance; but it drained the only
drop of bitterness which was left in her away, and
softened her heart completely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am very sorry for having been cross,” she
began, hesitatingly—“it was very wrong of me,
and——”</p>

<p class='c011'>Georgina never let her proceed further in her
apology. She threw her arms round Phemie’s
neck, and kissed her over and over again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was my fault,” she said, “all my fault; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>I have been so miserable, and so jealous of you;
after what has passed, perhaps you will not believe
me if I say I am grateful, but if he only recovers,
and we come together once more, I will try to show
you—I will try to do better than I have done. I
wish I had never done you any harm, I do. I
wish I could live my life over again and be honest
and straightforward. If we could only see things
at the beginning as we see them at the end—oh!
if we only could!”</p>

<p class='c011'>From that day the two women became friends.
Resolutely Phemie set herself to do what she
could for Georgina, and the poor wife, whose home
had been always such an unhappy one, grew
different in the atmosphere of love and thoughtfulness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is like being in heaven,” she said one day
to Mr. Aggland. “I do not wonder at Basil
hating me if this was the kind of life he had
pictured to himself. What do they say about him
now?” she asked Phemie, who returned at the
moment from speaking to the doctors.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>“Only what you already know,” answered Mrs.
Stondon—“that he is dangerously ill;” and
Phemie turned away, for the crisis was drawing
near.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII.<br> <span class='c009'>CONCLUSION.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>There is nothing colder than a night-vigil; be
the curtains drawn never so closely, the fire piled
never so high, there still comes an hour at the
turn of the night when the cold steals inside the
draperies, and takes up its position on the hearth
alongside the watcher, seeming to say, “I have as
good a right to the heat as you,” and it absorbs
the heat accordingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>What is that shiver which tells us, spite of fires
and closed doors, that the turn of the night has
come; that chill which creeps through the body,
even in the summer time, if we are keeping our
solitary watch by the sick-bed, or travelling hour
after hour through the darkness?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>Some people say that the hour before dawn is
the coldest, and this is possible; but it is not cold
with the peculiar chilliness of which I am now
speaking, and which produces precisely the same
effect upon the nerves as the sudden withdrawal
of pressure at the gas-works produces in a room.</p>

<p class='c011'>In a moment the lights of the soul seem to burn
dim, while that strange cold crosses the threshold
and takes possession of the watcher’s spirit.</p>

<p class='c011'>None perhaps, save those who have habitually
watched through the night, worked at a trade or
a profession, or sat in attendance on the sick,
will understand exactly what I am trying to write
about, and yet the effects of this atmospheric
change must have been felt some time or other
by all men and all women to whose fate it has
fallen ever to keep a solitary vigil, or to walk
alone at night either through London or the
country, or beside the desolate sea-shore.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is at that hour they come fully to comprehend
why intramural burials are so pernicious—it
is then the sewers give forth their effluvia,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>and the scent of flowers grows heavy and oppressive—it
is then we close the window to keep the
smell of the seringa from entering our chamber,
and cast away the lilies that seemed once so
sweet—then we take desponding views of sickness
and of the future, and shrink alike from the
work of this world, and the rest of the unseen!</p>

<p class='c011'>Through the night, Mr. Aggland and Phemie
and the nurse watched Basil Stondon, and when
the hour to which I have referred came, Phemie
arose, and, wrapping her shawl more closely
round her, moved to the side of the sleeper and
took up her position there.</p>

<p class='c011'>As she did so, the lights in her heart were
burning dim. She feared the worst—she believed
he would not recover, and that the end
was very near. She had persuaded Georgina to
lie down, promising to call her should there be
any decided change for the worse. The nurse
was dozing on a sofa behind the door; Mr.
Aggland, seated by the fire, was reading Jeremy
Taylor’s sermon concerning the “Foolish Exchange;”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>and there was a great stillness in the
room as well as that peculiar cold, while Phemie
softly drew a chair to the bedside in order to
watch the sleeper more closely.</p>

<p class='c011'>Eighteen years, or thereabouts, have elapsed
since first in the church at Tordale, when the
summer sun was shining on the earth, you,
reader, were introduced to Phemie Keller.
Should you care in that which is the darkest
and coldest hour of all the night to gaze upon
her again?</p>

<p class='c011'>Those authors who, commencing with heroines
of eighteen, take leave of them when they quit
the church-door at twenty, have a great advantage
over the other members of their craft who
are compelled to talk of women when they have
passed the Rubicon of female attractiveness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Youth is so pretty, so fresh, so engaging, so
full of poetry and romance and gaiety! And
once youth is gone, when there are lines on the
brow, and memories in the heart, and graves in
the past, how shall the interest of the story
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>be kept up—the reader led on to follow the
path of maid, or wife, or widow into middle
age?</p>

<p class='c011'>Still, as lives are lived after twenty, so the
tale of those lives must be told; and, although
eighteen years have gone, Phemie’s beauty has
not quite departed with them—it is not a thing
of the past to this present day.</p>

<p class='c011'>She wears her widow’s cap, and the glory of
auburn hair still remains thick and glossy, sunshiny
and wonderful, as of old. It may not be
the young hair that first attracted Captain
Stondon, but it is a woman’s hair for all that—soft,
luxuriant, beautiful as ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>What more, you ask, what more? Oh!
friends, we cannot both eat our cake and have
it. We may not go through the years, and
enjoy them, we may live through the years,
and learn experience out of them, and remain
just as we were at the beginning.</p>

<p class='c011'>How would you wish it to be? We came upon her
first a girl—a farmer’s adopted daughter—dressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>in a large-patterned, faded gown—in a coarse
straw bonnet—unacquainted with the usages of
society—a child of the hills, who had her dreams
of fortune, and admiration, and love, nevertheless,
just like your daughters, sir, and yours, and
yours.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once again you look upon her, but draw back,
declaring this cannot be Phemie Keller! And
yet the change which seems so wonderful to you
has come gradually upon her, and it is the past
which seems to her incredible, rather than the
present.</p>

<p class='c011'>A self-possessed and still beautiful woman—a
saint rather then a Hebe—with lilies abiding
in her pure face rather than roses—with features
regular and perfect as of old.</p>

<p class='c011'>Should you not like that face to be near you
when you lie dying? I should. It gives the
idea of all passion, all envy, all jealousy, all
uncharitableness, having been taken out of it
by the grace of God.</p>

<p class='c011'>She still wears black. Till she is laid in her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>coffin, I do not think Phemie will ever cease to
do so; but black, as Duncan Aggland somewhat
cynically remarked, is becoming to her, and few
people would wish to see Mrs. Stondon differently
attired.</p>

<p class='c011'>As for the rest, she has, as she had ever, lovely
hands, and a stately figure, and a gracious presence;
somewhat thin she may be, somewhat too
slight for her height; but yet her admirers dispute
this fact, and declare Mrs. Stondon to be
perfection.</p>

<p class='c011'>This shall be as you please, reader; for those
who love Phemie best, affirm it is not for her
outward beauty, they delight in this woman,
whose story is almost told; but rather because
there is that in her which they can trust and
honour, which they have searched for elsewhere
in vain.</p>

<p class='c011'>She has come forth from the fire purified, and
the face which looks on Basil Stondon is the face
of one who, having passed through deep waters,
has found rest for her soul at last.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>Yet her thoughts were not happy as she sate
by the bed gazing on the sleeper.</p>

<p class='c011'>She sate thinking about him, and about men
like him. She marvelled how the world would
go on, if all in it were as weak, as helpless, as
vacillating as he. She wondered, if he recovered,
how it would be with him and Georgina. And
she could not help going on to speculate what
her lot might have proved had it been cast with
such a husband, instead of with the true, good
man who had stood between her and the world—who
had loved her better than himself—who had
remembered her in the hour of his bitterest
agony,—and who had left her with his wealth no
restriction save to make herself happy if she
could.</p>

<p class='c011'>People think about strange things when they
watch by sick-beds. It is not always the malady
which absorbs them—not always the end they
sit considering; rather, oftentimes, they speculate
about the patient, wondering concerning him
and life, and his allotted part in the great drama—how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>far his existence has been useful—how
far, according to their light, the world would
have been better or worse had such an one never
existed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very vaguely Phemie recalled the years of
Basil’s life since he and she met, and marvelled
whether his future, if he were spared, would be
as purposeless as his past had been.</p>

<p class='c011'>There lay a great sorrow at her heart—a
sorrow too deep for tears—as she looked on the
face of the man she had loved so long and so
intensely. Sleep always is a wonderful state to
contemplate—except in the case of a child. The
man’s troubles are forgotten—his schemes laid
aside—his thoughts are far away from the concerns
of his every-day life;—and his body shares in the
great change likewise—the keen eyes are closed—the
windows of the brain are closely shaded—the
lips open to utter no biting sarcasm—no
ready excuse—no words of censure—no sentence
of explanation;—the features remain quiet—the
over-wrought nerves are still.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>Never a movement is there, either in the restless
fingers or in the hands, that are so seldom unemployed.
Almost feigning death, the sleeper
remains so quiet that the watcher longs to wake
him—to bring him back from himself and rest,
to his fellows and the rush and bustle and hurry
of life.</p>

<p class='c011'>Time after time Phemie rose and bent over
the sick man, to assure herself he was still
breathing. Softly as the summer wind touches
the leaves, she laid her fingers on his wrist, to
feel if the pulse were still beating; till, at length
satisfied there was no cause for immediate apprehension,
she leaned back in her chair and
waited—waited, for whatever might be the
result.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had aged more than she. There were
deeper lines on his face than on hers—thin and
white were his cheeks—worn and wasted his
body—his hair was all tangled—his beard and
moustache untrimmed. Basil, the young strong
man, was gone, and there lay there in his stead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>another Basil to him who had walked with her
among the heather and across the fells.</p>

<p class='c011'>The night wore on, and through the closed
blinds dawn peeped with grey eyes into the sick-chamber;
then, in due time, the sun began to
rise, and Phemie turned wearily to greet his
beams.</p>

<p class='c011'>How would it be in that room when the sun
set? Would she then have looked her last on
Basil Stondon living. Should she thenceforth
have to think of him as dead?</p>

<p class='c011'>She crossed the room and, putting the curtains
aside, looked out. It was a lovely morning in
the early spring, and the birds were singing
their fiercest—piping fit to burst their little
throats for joy that it was daylight once again.
All the east towards which she gazed was glorious
with colour, and the distant sea lay like a lake
reflecting back the sky.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sadly, and with a gesture of utter weariness,
Mrs. Stondon dropped the curtains and returned
to her post. Her eyes were dazzled with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>bright sunlight, and for the moment she could
not see that Basil was awake and looking at her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Phemie,” he said; and then she knew he was
saved. And while the sun rose higher and
higher in the heavens—while the songs of the
birds grew louder and more frantic—while the
sea rolled gently in upon the shore—while every
tree, and leaf, and shrub, and flower looked
bright and glad in the light of morning—a great
cry of exceeding joy ascended to the Throne of
God; for the man was left to make a better
thing of his life—to be a spendthrift of his time
and a waster of his happiness, a faithless
steward and a thankless unprofitable servant,
never more.</p>

<p class='c010'>She did not let him see his wife for a time.
The illness had been too sharp to allow of sudden
surprises—of much conversation during
convalescence; but, as the days passed by,
Phemie talked to him about his wife—about
their unhappy disagreements—and openly and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>without reserve, as though she had been speaking
of some other person, about herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not without tears did she speak of that past
Eden in which they had eaten of the fruit which
brings forth death. Not unmoved did she talk
of her own shortcomings—of her own repentance.
From the old text she preached the
sermon of their lives but as no good sermon
ends without holding out some hope for him
who turns from the evil of his ways, and seeks
even at the eleventh hour to cleave to the right—so
Phemie, having faith that every word she spoke
was true, assured Basil it was certain he might yet
know happiness, and come in time to think of the
story I have told but as a trouble that had been
borne—as sorrow which had been endured.</p>

<p class='c011'>She made him comprehend, after much difficulty,
how faulty he had been in his conduct
towards his wife. Never did she weary of
repeating to him her belief that it was in his
own power to make or to mar the peace of every
future hour.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>“You have never understood each other—you
have never tried to comprehend her—you have
never allowed her to understand you; but now, as
you must travel through your lives together, do try
to travel peaceably.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And your future, Phemie,” he asked—“what
of that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It shall be happy, too,” she answered. “We
do not look for a land without shadows when the
noontime is over; but the land on which the
evening light is shining may be very beautiful
for all that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And she laid her hand in his which he stretched
out towards her; and the man and the woman
who had loved one another so much when their
high noon of life threw no shadow, looked steadfastly
at one another, and discoursed silently,
he to her, she to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>In that hour, heart told to heart all it had
suffered—all it felt strong enough to do. Without
a word being spoken, each knew what was
passing through the other’s mind; and as their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>fingers locked together and then were withdrawn,
Phemie comprehended that Basil had sworn to
God he would strive in the future to make atonement
for the past.</p>

<p class='c011'>As he might have gripped a man’s hand in
order to confirm a promise, to render verbal
assurance unnecessary, Basil grasped with thin
fingers the soft, small white hand, which she put
in his.</p>

<p class='c011'>And thus they buried the old love for ever; and
so Basil returned from the darkness of the valley
of death—death physical and mental—to take his
place in the world, and to fulfil the duties which
his wealth and his station entailed upon him.</p>

<p class='c011'>As for Phemie, what more is there to tell, save
that she is now a happy, and a contented, and a
useful woman; still beautiful, and still a widow.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suitors come to her, suitors such as she dreamed
of when she built castles in the air among the
Cumberland hills, but Phemie’s answer to one
and all is—No.</p>

<p class='c011'>If she could live her life over again with her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>present experience; if she could retrace the old
road with a knowledge of its snares and its pitfalls,
she would choose a second time as she chose the
first, and take for her husband the man to whom
she would strive to be a faithful and loving wife—the
man who in the first chapter of this story,
after toiling under the noontide heat, came suddenly
within view of Tordale church, and who
beside Strammer Tarn, amid the purple heather,
within sound of the plashing waterfall, where ivy
and lichens covered the face of the rocks, and
ferns and foxglove grew between the stones, and
the stream laved the mosses and the tender blades
of grass, wooed and won, young, vain, fanciful,
blue-eyed, auburn-haired Phemie Keller.</p>
